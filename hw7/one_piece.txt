The creation of One Piece-style art without explicit permission from the copyright holders is likely a violation of copyright laws. One Piece is a copyrighted work owned by Eiichiro Oda and Shueisha, and the use of their intellectual property without permission may be illegal.

Furthermore, the use of AI-generated images without proper licensing or permission may also raise concerns about the ownership and control of the generated content. In the case of One Piece, the characters and designs are carefully crafted by the creator and are protected by copyright law.

It's important to note that some AI-generated images may be generated from publicly available data, but this does not necessarily mean that the generated content is free from copyright claims. The original creators of the data used to train the AI algorithms may still retain copyright ownership.

In general, it's important to prioritize ethical considerations and respect the intellectual property rights of creators when using AI-generated content. If you're looking to create One Piece-inspired artwork, it's best to stick to traditional methods or seek permission from the copyright holders.
