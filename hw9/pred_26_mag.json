  "arc_71": "Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion, unless acted upon by an external force. The force that counteracts gravity to keep a satellite in orbit is the centripetal force, which is the force that keeps the satellite moving in the same direction around the center of the Earth. The centripetal force is equal in magnitude to the centrifugal force, which is the force that causes the satellite to move away from the center of the Earth. Since the centripetal force is equal in magnitude to the centrifugal force, the net force on the satellite is zero, and it will continue to move in the same direction around the center of the Earth. Therefore, the answer is (A) inertia. The answer is (A) inertia.",
