  "arc_273": "The statement that best describes the availability of energy for organisms in different trophic levels is (B) Available energy decreases as trophic levels increase.\n\nIn a food chain, energy is transferred from one organism to another through the process of consumption. As an organism is consumed by a higher trophic level organism, the energy from that organism is transferred to the higher trophic level organism. This means that the energy available to the organisms in the higher trophic level decreases as the trophic level increases.\n\nFor example, a herbivore consumes the leaves of a plant, transferring energy from the plant to the herbivore. The herbivore is then consumed by a carnivore, transferring energy from the herbivore to the carnivore. The energy available to the carnivore is less than the energy available to the herbivore because the carnivore has a higher trophic level than the herbivore.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best describes the availability of energy for organisms in different trophic levels is (B) Available energy decreases as trophic levels increase.\n\nAnswer: (B) Available energy decreases as trophic levels increase.",

  "arc_325": "Answer: (B) The mass of the water in the glass is less than the mass of the ice.\nExplanation:The volume of the submerged ice is equal to the volume of water displaced, so the volume of the water in the glass is greater than the volume of the ice. The mass of the water in the glass is less than the mass of the ice, so the mass of the water in the glass is less than the mass of the ice. Therefore, the water in the glass is less massive than the ice, and the water in the glass is less dense than the ice. The density of the water in the glass is less than the density of the ice, so the density of the water in the glass is less than the density of the ice. Therefore, the water in the glass is less dense than the ice, and the density of the water in the glass is less than the density of the ice. Therefore, the water in the glass is less dense than the ice, and the density of the water in the glass is less than the density of the ice. Therefore, the water in the glass is less dense than the ice, and the density of the water in the glass is less than the density of the ice. Therefore, the water in the glass is less dense than the ice, and the density of the water in the glass is less than the density of the ice. Therefore, the water in the glass is less dense than the ice, and the density of the water in the glass is less than the density of the ice.
