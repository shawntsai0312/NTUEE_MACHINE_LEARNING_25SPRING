  "arc_76": "Answer: The correct answer is (C) designing an investigation with repeated trials during the investigation. Repeating trials during an investigation helps reduce bias because it allows the biologists to gather more data and reduce the chances of relying on a single piece of information. This method also allows the biologists to test their hypothesis multiple times, which can increase the confidence in their findings. The other options do not help reduce bias during an investigation. Developing a hypothesis after collecting data in the investigation can lead to confirmation bias, where the biologists form their hypothesis based on the data they want to see, rather than what the data actually shows. Limiting the amount of background research before the investigation can also lead to confirmation bias, as the biologists may only consider information that supports their hypothesis. Obtaining other opinions concerning what should happen during the investigation is not a method to reduce bias, as it does not directly address the issue of confirmation bias. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) designing an investigation with repeated trials during the investigation.",

  "arc_276": "Answer: (B) Earth has forests that provide heat through photosynthesis.\nExplanation: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of organic compounds, such as glucose. These organic compounds are then consumed by other organisms, such as herbivores, and the energy is transferred through the food chain. This process absorbs energy from the sun and converts it into chemical energy, which is then stored in the organic compounds. As a result, the Earth's surface does not become colder.\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct answer. The other options do not explain why the Earth's surface is not becoming colder. Option (A) is incorrect because the Earth does not constantly take in more heat from the Sun. Option (C) is incorrect because the oceans do not store heat.

  "arc_282": "Answer: (B) place concrete construction blocks on top of each bridge until it collapses.\nExplanation: The strength of a bridge is determined by its structural integrity, which is measured by its ability to withstand external forces. In this case, the force applied to the bridge is the weight of the blocks placed on top of it. Therefore, the bridge that can withstand the greatest weight will be the strongest. Placing concrete construction blocks on top of each bridge is the most accurate way to determine the strongest span design because it directly measures the bridge's ability to withstand weight. The other options do not accurately measure the bridge's strength because they do not directly apply an external force to the bridge. Rolling toy cars across the bridge may not accurately measure the bridge's strength because the force applied by the toy cars is not directly applied to the bridge. Placing coins on both ends of the bridge may not accurately measure the bridge's strength because the force applied by the coins is not directly applied to the bridge. Placing D-cell batteries at the center of the bridge may not accurately measure the bridge's strength because the force applied by the batteries is not directly applied to the bridge. Therefore, (B) place concrete construction blocks on top of each bridge until it collapses is the most accurate way to determine the strongest span design for these bridges.",
