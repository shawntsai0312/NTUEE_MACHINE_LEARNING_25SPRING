  "arc_59": "The correct answer is (C) The Earth's axis is tilted. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes the Sun to appear higher in the sky during summer months in the Northern Hemisphere and lower in the sky during winter months. As the Earth rotates on its axis, different parts of the planet experience different angles of incidence of the Sun's rays, resulting in day and night. The other options do not explain why daylight and darkness occur on Earth.",

  "arc_71": "Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. In other words, an object in motion will maintain its motion unless acted upon by an external force. Therefore, to keep a satellite in orbit, it must be acted upon by an external force that counteracts the force of gravity. This external force is the centripetal force, which is the force that keeps an object moving in a circular path. The centripetal force is always perpendicular to the radius of curvature and is equal in magnitude to the centrifugal force, which is the force that tends to fling an object away from the center of curvature. Since the centripetal force is equal in magnitude to the centrifugal force, the net force on the satellite is zero, and it will continue to move in its circular path. This is how the centripetal force counteracts the force of gravity to keep the satellite in orbit. Therefore, the answer is (A) inertia. The answer is (A) inertia.",

The answer is (C) microscope.",
  "arc_98": "The correct answer is (B) transporting oxygen to organs. The circulatory system works with the respiratory system by transporting oxygen from the lungs to the organs of the body, such as the brain, liver, and kidneys, where it is used for metabolic processes. The respiratory system takes in oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, which is then transported by the circulatory system to the organs for use in metabolic processes. Without the circulatory system, the respiratory system would not be able to transport oxygen to the organs, and the body's metabolic processes would not be able to occur. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) transporting oxygen to organs.",

Vegetative budding, on the other hand, is the process by which a haploid organism produces a diploid offspring that is genetically identical to the parent organism. Therefore, meiosis is necessary for sexual reproduction to occur, but vegetative budding is not. The answer is (A) vegetative budding.",
  "arc_108": "The correct answer is (D) Roll a ball from the top of an inclined plane and determine the amount of time it takes to get to the bottom. Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state. When the ball rolls down the inclined plane, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. The time it takes for the ball to reach the bottom is a direct measure of the potential energy converted into kinetic energy. Therefore, this investigation is the best way to demonstrate potential energy. The answer is (D) Roll a ball from the top of an inclined plane and determine the amount of time it takes to get to the bottom.",

An anemometer is a device that measures wind speed by measuring the force exerted by the wind on a stationary object, such as a propeller or a fan. It is the best tool for measuring wind speed because it measures the speed of the wind at a specific point in space, unlike a barometer, which measures atmospheric pressure, or a hygrometer, which measures the amount of moisture in the air. A weather vane measures the direction of the wind, but not its speed. Therefore, the student should use an anemometer to measure changes in wind speed several hours before a storm. The answer is (C).",
  "arc_121": "The Sun most affects the water cycle by creating water droplets in the clouds. The Sun's energy heats the water in the oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing the water to evaporate and rise into the atmosphere as water vapor. As the water vapor rises, it cools and condenses into water droplets, forming clouds. These water droplets can then condense and form precipitation, such as rain or snow, depending on the temperature and humidity of the air. Therefore, the Sun is the primary source of energy that drives the water cycle by creating water droplets in the clouds. The answer is (B).",
