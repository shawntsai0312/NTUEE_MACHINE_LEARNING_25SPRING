This means that if Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, Butler High School enrolls:\n\n4000 x (3/4) = 2800\n\nSo, the average enrollment at Butler High School is 2800 students. Now, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment is at Norman High School than at Butler High School. We can do this by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:\n\nAverage enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School = 4000 - 2800 = 1200\n\nTherefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1200 students greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School. The correct answer is (A) 3200.",

The correct answer is (C) 5.",
  "arc_1": "The correct answer is (B) from the remains of organisms. Fossil fuels are formed when the remains of ancient plants and animals are buried and subjected to high temperatures and pressures over millions of years. This process, known as diagenesis, transforms the organic matter into fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_4": "The correct answer is (A) Rainfall increases.\n\nWhen trees develop leaves in the spring, it signals the start of the growing season, and with it comes an increase in rainfall. As the leaves grow and expand, they absorb more water from the soil, leading to an increase in rainfall on the forest floor. This increase in rainfall helps to support the growth and development of the trees and other vegetation in the forest.\n\nThe other options are not correct explanations for the changes that occur on the forest floor when trees develop leaves in the spring:\n\n* (B) Sunlight is reduced: As trees grow and their leaves expand, they can block sunlight from reaching the forest floor, but this is not the primary cause of changes on the forest floor.\n* (C) Wind speed increases: Wind speed can increase in the spring as the weather warms up, but this does not directly cause changes on the forest floor.\n* (D) Animal migration is stopped: Animal migration is not directly related to the development of leaves on trees in the spring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Rainfall increases.",

  "arc_11": "The correct answer is (C) Soil must be created.\n\nAfter a volcanic eruption, it takes a long time for large ecosystems to fully recover because the ash, lava, and other debris from the eruption can alter the soil structure and chemistry, making it difficult for plants to grow. The soil must be created through a process of weathering and erosion, which can take years or even decades to occur. During this time, the soil is not suitable for plant growth, and the ecosystem is unable to recover.\n\nThe other options are not correct explanations for why it takes a long time for large ecosystems to fully recover after a volcanic eruption:\n\n* (A) Space is limited for growth: This is not a factor in the recovery time after a volcanic eruption, as the availability of space does not affect the rate of soil formation.\n* (B) The quality of light is low: While light is important for plant growth, the quality of light does not determine the rate of soil formation.\n* (D) Minerals are destroyed: While minerals may be destroyed during a volcanic eruption, this is not the primary reason why it takes a long time for large ecosystems to fully recover.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Soil must be created.",
  "arc_12": "Based on the information provided, the correct answer is (A) quartz.\n\nQuartz is a mineral that is commonly found in rocks and is attracted to magnets. The student picking up a small rock using a magnet suggests that the rock contains quartz. Diamond, aluminum, and iron are not typically found in rocks and are not attracted to magnets, so they are not the correct answers.",

While trees do produce oxygen through photosynthesis, the fossil record does not provide evidence of this process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) The environment has changed.",
  "arc_17": "The answer is (D) estuary.\n\nEstuaries are areas where freshwater from rivers and streams mixes with saltwater from the ocean. As a result, the water in estuaries is brackish, meaning it has a mixture of fresh and saltwater properties. Therefore, option (D) estuary is the correct answer.",
  "arc_18": "The best evidence for the theory of continental drift is (A) the appearance of volcanoes at the boundaries where plates collide.\n\nThe theory of continental drift proposes that the Earth's continents have moved over time due to the movement of tectonic plates. One of the key pieces of evidence for this theory is the presence of volcanoes at the boundaries where plates collide. These volcanoes are formed when magma rises to the surface as a result of the plate movement. The presence of volcanoes at these boundaries provides strong evidence for the theory of continental drift, as it suggests that the plates are moving and causing the formation of new land.\n\nThe other options do not provide as strong evidence for the theory of continental drift:\n\n(B) earthquakes at boundaries where one plate slides past another: While earthquakes do occur at boundaries where plates are in contact and sliding past each other, they do not provide direct evidence for the theory of continental drift. Earthquakes can occur for a variety of reasons, including the movement of tectonic plates, but they do not necessarily indicate that the plates are moving.\n\n(C) cases where a species exists in only one isolated place: While it is true that some species are found in only one isolated place, this does not necessarily provide evidence for the theory of continental drift. There are many reasons why a species might be found in only one place, including geographical isolation, evolutionary history, and habitat destruction.\n\n(D) fossils of the same species found on widely separated continents: While the presence of fossils of the same species found on widely separated continents can provide evidence for the theory of continental drift, it is not the strongest evidence. Fossils can be formed through a variety of processes, including",

Penicillin works by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria, making it an effective treatment for a wide range of bacterial infections. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_21": "The correct answer is (B) The alveoli in the lungs.\n\nStomata are tiny pores located on the leaves of plants that permit the exchange of gases between air in the environment and plant cells located inside the leaf. In vertebrates, a similar function is performed by the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs located in the lungs. The alveoli are responsible for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air in the lungs and the bloodstream.\n\nThe cornea in the eye, the chambers in the heart, and the salivary glands in the mouth do not perform a similar function to stomata in vertebrates. The cornea is a transparent layer of tissue that covers the front of the eye and helps to focus light, while the chambers in the heart are chambers that pump blood throughout the body. The salivary glands in the mouth produce saliva, which helps to break down food in the mouth.",

  "arc_30": "The correct answer is (B) Cats were domesticated earlier than originally thought.\n\nThe discovery of the remains of an eight-month old cat buried with its owner on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus suggests that cats were domesticated earlier than previously believed. The burial date came before the time of ancient Egyptian civilization, which was previously thought to be the origin of cat domestication. This finding challenges the traditional view that cats were first domesticated in Egypt around 4000 BCE.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because wildcats and house cats are closely related and share a common ancestor.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that wildcats were not domesticated. In fact, archaeological evidence suggests that cats were domesticated in the Near East around 10,000 years ago.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the period of Egyptian civilization is well-documented and widely accepted by historians and archaeologists. The discovery of the cat remains on Cyprus does not challenge the established timeline of Egyptian civilization.",

The other options, (B) milling, (C) finishing, and (D) refining, do not accurately describe the process of making ceramic cups.",
  "arc_34": "The correct answer is (C) pictures of stars of different ages.\n\nThe theory of star formation is based on scientific observations and data collected through various methods, including astronomical observations and simulations. Pictures of stars of different ages provide valuable information about the life cycle of stars, including their formation, evolution, and death. These pictures can help scientists understand the physical processes involved in star formation, such as the collapse of interstellar gas and dust, the formation of protostars and protoplanetary disks, and the later stages of star evolution.\n\nWhile laws passed by the government and Internet sites discussing star formation may provide some general information about the subject, they are not directly related to the scientific evidence and data required to support the theory of star formation. Similarly, while evaluations of data by many scientists can contribute to the development and refinement of the theory, the primary evidence comes from direct observations and measurements of stars and their properties.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) pictures of stars of different ages.",
  "arc_38": "The correct answer is (B) Sugar. Sugar is a pure substance, meaning it is composed of a single type of molecule (sucrose) and does not contain any other substances. Smoke, milk, and paint are all mixtures, as they are composed of a combination of different substances.",
  "arc_41": "The correct answer is (C) collecting rainwater.\n\nExplanation: Earth has a limited supply of fresh drinking water, and recycling water is crucial to conserve this valuable resource. Collecting rainwater is one method used to recycle water for human use. Rainwater is free and can be collected from rooftops and other surfaces, and it can be treated and used for various purposes such as irrigation, toilet flushing, and drinking water. Bottling water, dam construction, and wastewater treatment are not effective methods for recycling water for human use. Bottling water involves extracting water from natural sources and packaging it in plastic bottles, which can contribute to pollution and waste. Dam construction can disrupt ecosystems and cause environmental damage. Wastewater treatment is a process that removes pollutants from wastewater, but it does not provide fresh drinking water.",
  "arc_43": "The correct answer is (C) root. Dandelions have a deep taproot that takes in minerals and water from the soil. The root system of a dandelion plant can grow up to 10 inches deep and is responsible for absorbing water and minerals from the soil, which are then transported to the rest of the plant through the xylem. Therefore, option (C) root is the correct answer.",
  "arc_44": "The correct answer is (B) ice sublimating.\n\nExothermic processes are chemical reactions that release heat energy, while endothermic processes absorb heat energy. Ice sublimation is the process by which ice transforms directly into water vapor without melting, releasing heat energy in the process.

  "arc_49": "Based on the information provided, the correct answer is (B) The speed and direction of the object will remain constant.\n\nWhen forces acting on an object are balanced, the object will maintain its initial velocity, or speed, and direction of motion. This is known as the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum of an isolated system remains constant over time. As long as the forces acting on the object are balanced, the object will continue to move in a straight line with a constant speed.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because the speed and direction of the object will not change as long as the forces acting on it remain balanced. Option (C) is also incorrect because the direction of the object will not change as long as the forces acting on it remain balanced. Option (D) is incorrect because the speed of the object will not change as long as the forces acting on it remain balanced.",
  "arc_51": "The correct answer is (A) food and soil.\n\nA fire can take away the food and soil that squirrels need to survive.

  "arc_59": "The correct answer is (C) The Earth's axis is tilted.\n\nDaylight and darkness occur on Earth due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes the Sun to appear above or below the horizon at different times of the year, resulting in daylight and darkness.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the Earth does not rotate on its axis. The Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, which is why we experience day and night in a cycle.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because the Sun does not rotate on its axis. The Sun is a massive ball of hot, glowing gas and does not have a rotating axis.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the Earth does revolve around the Sun, but this does not explain why daylight and darkness occur. The Earth's orbit around the Sun is elliptical, which means that the distance between the Earth and the Sun varies throughout the year. This variation in distance causes the Sun to appear larger or smaller in the sky, which also affects the amount of daylight and darkness experienced on Earth.",
  "arc_61": "The correct answer is (B) maintains genetic diversity.\n\nSexual reproduction allows for the mixing of genetic material from two parents, resulting in offspring that have a greater genetic diversity than either parent. This increased genetic diversity can help a population survive and adapt to changing environmental conditions by providing a wider range of genetic traits that can be expressed in the offspring.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because mutation is a random change in the DNA sequence of an organism, and it does not provide any advantage in the survival of a population.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because reducing the number of genes does not provide any advantage in the survival of a population. In fact, a reduction in the number of genes can lead to a loss of genetic diversity, which can make a population more vulnerable to extinction.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because competition between siblings is not an advantage in the survival of a population. In fact, competition between siblings can lead to a reduction in the overall fitness of the population, as individuals may compete for limited resources and space.",
  "arc_62": "The correct answer is (B) The energy is dissipated as heat.\n\nIn an ecosystem, not all of the energy that is available is used by the organisms. Some energy becomes unavailable before it can be transferred to organisms in the next trophic level due to various reasons. One of the main ways in which energy becomes unavailable is through dissipation as heat. This occurs when energy is transferred from one level to another through a series of chemical reactions, but some of the energy is lost as heat before it can be used by the organisms.\n\nThe other options are not correct explanations for how energy becomes unavailable in an ecosystem:\n\n* (A) The energy is stored as food: While some energy may be stored as food, it is not the primary way in which energy becomes unavailable in an ecosystem. Most of the energy stored as food is eventually broken down and released back into the environment, rather than being stored for long periods of time.\n* (C) The energy is trapped in dead organisms: Dead organisms do not necessarily trap energy. While some energy may be stored in the form of organic matter, such as fossil fuels, most of the energy in dead organisms is eventually broken down and released back into the environment.\n* (D) The energy is moved to another ecosystem: Energy can be transferred between ecosystems, but it does not become unavailable in the process. Energy is still available for use by organisms in the receiving ecosystem.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) The energy is dissipated as heat.",

This tilt is responsible for the changing seasons, as different parts of the planet are tilted towards or away from the sun at different times of the year.\n\nTides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the ocean, and are not directly related to Earth's tilt on its axis.\n\nWeather is also not directly related to Earth's tilt on its axis, as weather patterns are influenced by a complex array of factors, including atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity.\n\nGravity is the force that attracts objects towards each other, and is not directly related to Earth's tilt on its axis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) seasons.",
  "arc_65": "The correct answer is (A) weight.\n\nWeight is most influenced by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and overall lifestyle. For example, a person who consumes a healthy diet and exercises regularly is more likely to have a lower weight than someone who consumes a high-calorie diet and leads a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nOn the other hand, hair color, blood type, and handedness are largely determined by genetics and are less influenced by environmental factors. Hair color is determined by the genes inherited from one's parents, while blood type is determined by the presence or absence of specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells. Handedness, or the tendency to favor one hand over the other, is also influenced by genetics, although environmental factors can also play a role.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_66": "The correct answer is (D) genes.\n\nIn plants, genes are responsible for passing traits from one generation to the next. Genes are the units of heredity that carry the information necessary for the development and function of an organism. They are passed down from parent to offspring through the reproductive process, and the combination of genes from each parent determines the characteristics of the offspring.\n\nChloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells that are responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. While chloroplasts are important for plant growth and development, they are not directly involved in passing traits from one generation to the next.\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy, but it is not responsible for passing traits from one generation to the next.\n\nRoots are underground structures that are important for plant growth and development, but they are not responsible for passing traits from one generation to the next.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) genes.",

Migration is a natural behavior exhibited by many bird species, and it is an important adaptation that helps them survive and thrive in different environments throughout the year.",
  "arc_71": "According to Newton's first law of motion, an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force. In the case of a satellite in orbit, the force of gravity is acting on the satellite, trying to pull it towards the Earth's surface. However, the satellite is also moving at a significant speed, which means that it has a lot of kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is what counteracts the force of gravity and keeps the satellite in orbit. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) inertia.",
  "arc_73": "The correct answer is (A) decreases over a period of time and is lost.\n\nWhen an ice cube melts, the energy of the particles does indeed decrease over time as the ice transforms into liquid water. This energy is lost to the surroundings as heat, which is why the ice cube melts. The other options are not correct explanations for why an ice cube melts on a hot summer day.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the particles in the ice do not increase in distance from each other as the ice melts. Instead, the particles move closer together as the ice transforms into a more disordered state.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the particles in the ice do not move closer together as the ice melts. Instead, they move farther apart as the ice transforms into a more disordered state.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the energy of the particles in the ice is not converted into potential energy as it melts. Instead, the energy is lost to the surroundings as heat.",
  "arc_76": "The correct answer is (C) designing an investigation with repeated trials during the investigation.\n\nTo reduce bias during an investigation, it is important to use a rigorous and systematic approach that minimizes the influence of personal opinions or preconceptions. One way to do this is to design an investigation with repeated trials, where the same procedure is repeated multiple times under the same conditions. This helps to ensure that any observed results are not due to random chance or personal bias, but rather due to the natural behavior of the living organism being investigated.\n\nOption (A) developing a hypothesis after collecting data in the investigation is also important, as it helps to ensure that the investigation is focused and well-defined. However, it does not directly address the issue of bias.\n\nOption (B) limiting the amount of background research before the investigation may help to reduce bias by avoiding the influence of preexisting knowledge or opinions. However, it may not be practical or feasible to completely eliminate background research, as it is often necessary to understand the context and background of the investigation.\n\nOption (D) obtaining other opinions concerning what should happen during the investigation is not a reliable method for reducing bias, as it relies on the opinions of others rather than scientific evidence and reasoning. It is important to rely on scientific evidence and reasoning when conducting an investigation, rather than relying on the opinions of others.\n\nIn conclusion, the best method for reducing bias during an investigation is to design an investigation with repeated trials during the investigation. This approach helps to ensure that any observed results are due to the natural behavior of the living organism being investigated, rather than personal opinions or preconceptions.",
  "arc_77": "The correct answer is (C) microscope.\n\nA microscope is the best tool to use when studying small organisms not visible to the eye because it provides a magnified view of the organisms, allowing for a closer examination of their structure and details. A telescope is used to observe distant objects in the sky, while a hand lens or magnifying glass can only provide a limited magnification and are not suitable for studying small organisms.",
  "arc_81": "The correct answer is (B) a cell.\n\nAll living organisms are composed of cells, which are the basic structural and functional units of life. Cells are present in all organisms, from bacteria to humans, and are essential for the organism's growth, reproduction, and survival. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* (A) a tissue is a group of cells that perform a specific function, but not all organisms have the same types of tissues.\n* (C) a stomach is an organ that digests food, but not all organisms have a stomach.\n* (D) a brain is a structure that is present in many organisms, including animals and some invertebrates, but not all organisms have a brain.",
  "arc_83": "The correct answer is (C) passing the gene for DDT resistance to their offspring.\n\nDDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) is a pesticide that was widely used in the 1970s to control insects that damaged fruit and vegetable crops. However, DDT was found to be harmful to the environment and human health, leading to its eventual ban in many countries.\n\nWhen DDT was used, most insects died from being exposed to it, but some survived. These surviving insects had a genetic mutation that made them resistant to DDT. As these resistant insects reproduced, they passed their resistance gene to their offspring, leading to an increase in the population of DDT-resistant insects.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because migrating to habitats with different types of crops would not increase the population of DDT-resistant insects. Option (B) is also incorrect because learning how to avoid being exposed to DDT would not increase the population of DDT-resistant insects. Option (D) is incorrect because competing with other types of insects for food would not increase the population of DDT-resistant insects.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) passing the gene for DDT resistance to their offspring.",
  "arc_88": "The correct answer is (C) epidemic.\n\nAn epidemic is a widespread outbreak of a disease in a population, often occurring suddenly and affecting a large number of people. The term \"epidemic\" is used to describe a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease in a particular area or population, and it is often associated with a high degree of contagiousness and a rapid spread of the disease.\n\nIn the case of AIDS, the disease was first identified in the late 1950s in Africa, and since then, it has spread rapidly around the world, infecting tens of millions of people and causing tens of millions of deaths. This fits the definition of an epidemic, as it is a widespread outbreak of a disease that has affected a large number of people in a relatively short period of time.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe the disease AIDS:\n\n* (A) Isolated cases refers to a small number of individuals who are infected with a disease, rather than a large-scale outbreak.\n* (B) Outbreak refers to a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease in a particular area or population, but it does not necessarily imply a large-scale spread of the disease.\n* (D) Pandemic refers to a global outbreak of a disease that affects a large number of people across multiple countries or continents. While AIDS has spread globally, it is not a pandemic in the classical sense, as it is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, sharing of needles, and mother-to-child transmission, rather than through airborne transmission.",
  "arc_90": "The correct answer is (C) Put the mixture through a sieve, and the sand will remain in the sieve.\n\nExplanation:\n\nKatie can separate the iron filings from the sand by passing the mixture through a sieve. A sieve is a tool that separates materials based on their size. The sand is too large to pass through the holes in the sieve, so it will remain in the sieve, while the iron filings will pass through and be separated from the sand.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because shaking the mixture will not cause the iron filings to rise to the surface.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because adding water to the mixture will not dissolve the sand. Sand is a solid material and will not dissolve in water.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because a magnet will not attract iron filings. Iron filings are not magnetic, so a magnet will not have any effect on them.",
  "arc_92": "The correct answer is (B) gravity. As the rocket moves away from Earth, it must act against the force of gravity in order to escape the planet's gravitational pull and travel into space.",
  "arc_94": "The correct answer is (C) ozone.\n\nThe stratosphere is a layer of the atmosphere that extends from about 12 to 50 kilometers (7.5 to 31 miles) above the Earth's surface. The temperature in the stratosphere increases with altitude due to the presence of ozone (O3), a gas that absorbs ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. This absorption of UV radiation heats the stratosphere, causing the temperature to rise with altitude.\n\nNitrogen (N2) is a major component of the atmosphere, but it does not play a significant role in the temperature structure of the stratosphere. Water vapor (H2O) is also present in the stratosphere, but it does not contribute significantly to the temperature increase with altitude. Carbon monoxide (CO) is not a significant component of the stratosphere.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) ozone.",
  "arc_96": "The correct answer is (C) microscope. A microscope is the most helpful tool for a scientist observing very small bacteria because it allows them to see the bacteria up close and in detail. The other options, a ruler, telescope, and meter stick, are not as useful for observing small bacteria as a microscope.",
  "arc_98": "The correct answer is (B) transporting oxygen to organs.\n\nThe circulatory system and the respiratory system work together to maintain homeostasis in the human body. The circulatory system transports oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and organs, while the respiratory system takes in oxygen from the environment and releases carbon dioxide. Without the circulatory system, the body's tissues and organs would not be able to obtain the oxygen they need to function properly.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow and are responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body, but they are not directly involved in the process of transporting oxygen to organs.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because nutrients are transported through the circulatory system, but they are not the primary function of the circulatory system.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because while the respiratory system does control the movement of the lungs, it is not the primary function of the respiratory system. The primary function of the respiratory system is to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.",
  "arc_99": "The correct answer is (C) carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most significant contributor to the greenhouse effect, as it is the primary greenhouse gas responsible for trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. Other greenhouse gases, such as wood smoke and nitrous oxides, also contribute to the greenhouse effect, but to a much lesser extent than CO2. Nuclear radiation is not a greenhouse gas and does not contribute to the greenhouse effect.",
  "arc_104": "The correct answer is (C) an increase in volcanic activity under the oceans.\n\nThe statement \"Some types of bacteria can only live where oxygen is not present\" indicates that these bacteria are anaerobic, meaning they do not require oxygen to survive. These bacteria were well adapted to life on Earth over 2 billion years ago, suggesting that they were able to thrive in environments without oxygen.\n\nHowever, an increase in volcanic activity under the oceans could have caused many of these anaerobic bacteria to become extinct. Volcanic activity can release large amounts of toxic gases, including sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, which can be lethal to anaerobic bacteria. As the volcanic activity increased, these toxic gases could have accumulated in the oceans, making it difficult or impossible for the anaerobic bacteria to survive.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the information provided:\n\n* (A) the slow movement of tectonic plates is not related to the extinction of anaerobic bacteria.\n* (B) the varying temperatures of each season do not directly affect the survival of anaerobic bacteria.\n* (D) an increase in the number of photosynthetic organisms is not likely to cause the extinction of anaerobic bacteria, as photosynthetic organisms require oxygen to survive and would not compete directly with anaerobic bacteria for resources.",
  "arc_105": "The correct answer is (C) Kinetic energy.\n\nAll moving objects have kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. This energy is associated with the motion of an object, and it is a form of potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy as the object moves. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and it is measured in units of kilogram-meters per second squared (kg·m/s^2).\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* Light energy is the energy of light, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation. It is not the same as kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion.\n* Solar energy is the energy from the sun that is converted into other forms of energy, such as electricity or heat. It is not the same as kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion.\n* Renewable energy is energy that is generated from natural sources that can be replenished, such as wind, solar, or hydroelectric power. It is not the same as kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Kinetic energy.",
  "arc_106": "The correct answer is (B) binary fission.\n\nMeiosis is the process by which a sexually reproducing organism produces gametes (sperm or egg cells) that are genetically unique and contain half the genetic material of the parent cell. This process is necessary for sexual reproduction, as it allows for the mixing of genetic material from two parents and the creation of genetically diverse offspring. Binary fission, on the other hand, is the process of cell division in which a cell divides into two identical daughter cells. This process is not necessary for sexual reproduction, as it does not involve the creation of genetically diverse offspring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) binary fission.",
  "arc_108": "The correct answer is (C) Compress a spring by different amounts, and see how far it can launch a ball into the air.\n\nExplanation: Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or configuration. In this investigation, the spring is compressed by different amounts, which increases the potential energy stored in the spring. When the spring is released, the energy is converted into kinetic energy as the ball is launched into the air. This demonstrates the concept of potential energy and how it can be converted into kinetic energy.\n\nThe other options do not demonstrate potential energy in the same way:\n\nOption (A) rolling one ball toward another and seeing what happens when they collide does not demonstrate potential energy. The energy transferred between the balls is due to their motion, not their position or configuration.\n\nOption (B) placing a glass of water in the freezer and seeing how long it takes to become solid does not demonstrate potential energy. The energy required to change the state of the water from liquid to solid is due to the temperature change, not the position or configuration of the water.\n\nOption (D) rolling a ball from the top of an inclined plane and determining the amount of time it takes to get to the bottom does not demonstrate potential energy. The energy required to roll the ball down the inclined plane is due to its motion, not its position or configuration.",
  "arc_109": "The correct answer is (A) lose a proton. When an atom gains an electron, it will have a net positive charge, as the number of electrons exceeds the number of protons. Therefore, the atom will lose a proton to balance the charge.",
  "arc_111": "The correct answer is (A) physical properties.\n\nAppearance, texture, and density are all physical properties of a substance, which are characteristics that can be observed and measured without changing the substance's chemical composition. These properties are determined by the arrangement of atoms and molecules in the substance and do not involve any chemical reactions or changes to the substance's composition. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_116": "The correct answer is (D) copper. Copper is the best conductor of heat at room temperature due to its high thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity is the ability of a material to transfer heat energy, and copper has one of the highest thermal conductivities of any material at room temperature. This means that copper can efficiently transfer heat energy, making it the best conductor of heat at room temperature. The other options, air, water, and sulfur, are not as effective conductors of heat at room temperature.",
  "arc_118": "The correct answer is (A) a tissue.\n\nA group of cells that perform the same function in the body is called a tissue. Tissues are composed of a large number of cells that are similar in structure and function, and they work together to perform a specific function in the body. Examples of tissues include muscle tissue, nervous tissue, and epithelial tissue.\n\nOn the other hand, an organelle is a small organ or structure within a cell that performs a specific function. For example, the mitochondria is an organelle found in the cells of most living organisms, and it is responsible for generating energy for the cell through the process of cellular respiration.\n\nAn organism is a living being that consists of one or more cells, and it is made up of different tissues and organs that work together to perform various functions. For example, a human organism is made up of many different tissues, including muscle tissue, nervous tissue, and epithelial tissue, which work together to perform functions such as movement, sensation, and digestion.\n\nFinally, a system is a group of organs and tissues that work together to perform a specific function in the body. For example, the circulatory system is made up of the heart, blood vessels, and blood, and it is responsible for transporting oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells and removing waste products.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) a tissue.",
  "arc_119": "Based on scientific facts and knowledge, the correct answer is (B) dead zones where there are no fish.\n\nThe decomposition of algae blooms in the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico can lead to the formation of dead zones, also known as hypoxic zones, where there is not enough dissolved oxygen to support most aquatic life. This can occur when excess nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, from fertilizers and other sources stimulate the growth of algae, which can then decompose and use up oxygen in the water. As a result, fish and other aquatic organisms may not be able to survive in these areas, leading to a reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem function.\n\nThe other options are not correct explanations for the decomposition of algae blooms in the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico:\n\n* (A) an abundance of dissolved oxygen: While it is true that algae blooms can produce dissolved oxygen through photosynthesis, the decomposition of these blooms can actually lead to a reduction in dissolved oxygen levels, as described above.\n* (C) a reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide: The decomposition of algae blooms does not directly affect atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.\n* (D) food webs with rapidly growing populations: The decomposition of algae blooms can lead to a reduction in the abundance and diversity of aquatic organisms, which can have cascading effects throughout food webs. However, this is not the direct result of the decomposition of algae blooms.",
  "arc_120": "The correct answer is (C) anemometer. An anemometer is a device used to measure wind speed and direction. It is specifically designed to measure wind speed several hours before a storm, as it can detect changes in wind speed and direction that may indicate an approaching storm. A barometer measures atmospheric pressure, a hygrometer measures humidity, and a weather vane measures wind direction, but none of these devices are suitable for measuring wind speed several hours before a storm.",
  "arc_121": "The correct answer is (A) The Sun causes the ocean water to evaporate.\n\nThe Sun's heat energy is the primary driver of the water cycle. Through a process called evaporation, the Sun's warmth causes water molecules to change from a liquid to a gas, and they rise into the atmosphere as water vapor. This water vapor eventually condenses into clouds, which can produce precipitation in the form of rain or snow. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_122": "The correct answer is (A): The molecules will begin to move slower.\n\nAs the ice cube is heated, the molecules in the ice will gain kinetic energy and begin to move faster. This is because the temperature of the ice is increasing, which means that the molecules are gaining energy and moving more quickly. As the temperature continues to rise, the molecules will eventually reach a point where they are moving at their maximum speed, which is known as the melting point of the ice. At this point, the molecules will begin to move slower as they transition from a solid to a liquid state.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the behavior of the molecules in the ice as it is heated.",
  "arc_124": "The correct answer is (C) Fe and O. Iron oxides, such as rust, form when iron metal reacts with oxygen in the air. The chemical symbol for iron is Fe, and the chemical symbol for oxygen is O. Therefore, the chemical symbols for the two elements found in iron oxide are Fe and O.",
  "arc_125": "The correct answer is (C) They inherited the same characteristics from their parents.\n\nIdentical twins are created when a single fertilized egg splits in two and develops into two separate embryos. Since they come from the same egg, they share the same genetic material, which means they inherit the same traits and characteristics from their parents. This is why they often look so similar, as they have inherited many of the same physical and genetic traits from their parents.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because being born on the same day is not a determining factor in why identical twins look alike.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because having the same interests is not a determining factor in why identical twins look alike.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because being taught the same things at home is not a determining factor in why identical twins look alike.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) They inherited the same characteristics from their parents.",
  "arc_126": "The correct answer is (A) condensation.\n\nCondensation is the process by which water vapor in the air changes back into liquid water. This process occurs when the air reaches its dew point, which is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated with water vapor and can no longer hold any more moisture. At this point, the water vapor condenses into droplets of water, forming clouds, fog, or dew.\n\nTranspiration is the process by which plants release water vapor into the air through their leaves. This process occurs when the plant's leaves absorb water from the soil and release it into the air as water vapor.\n\nEvaporation is the process by which liquid water changes into water vapor. This process occurs when the water is heated and its temperature rises above its boiling point, causing the water molecules to turn into water vapor.\n\nPrecipitation is the process by which water droplets in the air fall to the ground as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. This process occurs when the air is cooled to its dew point, causing the water droplets to condense and fall to the ground.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) condensation.",
  "arc_128": "The correct answer is (B) evaporation.\n\nAs temperatures increase, the kinetic energy of the molecules in the atmosphere also increases, causing them to move faster and faster. This increased motion leads to an increase in the rate of evaporation, which is the process by which water molecules transition from a liquid to a gas. As more water molecules evaporate, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere also increases.\n\nIonization, respiration, and condensation are not directly related to the increase in water vapor in the atmosphere due to temperature increases. Ionization is the process by which a neutral atom or molecule gains or loses electrons to form ions. Respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose into energy. Condensation is the process by which a gas is transformed into a liquid. None of these processes are directly related to the increase in water vapor in the atmosphere due to temperature increases.",
  "arc_132": "The correct answer is (A) chemical reaction.\n\nRust is a chemical compound that forms when iron combines with oxygen in a moist environment. The reaction involves the oxidation of iron, which results in the formation of iron oxide (rust). This process is a chemical reaction, not a physical reaction or a change in density or temperature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) chemical reaction.",
  "arc_134": "The correct answer is (C) gravity.\n\nWhen riding a roller coaster, an electric motor pulls the roller coaster to the top of the first hill by applying a force. As the roller coaster begins to descend the hill, the force of gravity pulls the roller coaster downward. Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards the center of the Earth, and it is the force that causes the roller coaster to accelerate down the hill. Friction, speed, and mass do not play a significant role in the motion of the roller coaster on the first hill.",
  "arc_137": "The correct answer is (C) 28 days. The lunar cycle refers to the time it takes for the Moon to complete one orbit around the Earth, which is approximately 28 days.",
  "arc_139": "The correct answer is (A) root.\n\nThe roots of a plant are responsible for taking in water and nutrients from the soil. The roots absorb water and minerals from the soil through tiny hair-like structures called root hairs, which increase the surface area of the root for absorption. The water and nutrients are then transported to the rest of the plant through the xylem, a vascular tissue that transports water and nutrients throughout the plant.\n\nThe stem, flower, and leaf are important parts of a plant as well, but they are not involved in the process of taking in water and nutrients from the soil. The stem provides support and structure for the plant, the flower is responsible for reproduction, and the leaf is responsible for photosynthesis and transpiration.",
  "arc_140": "The correct answer is (A) adapt to a changed landscape.\n\nThe removal of waste from Florida's East Bay and Pensacola Bay is intended to allow the ecosystem to adapt to the changed conditions caused by pollution. By removing the waste, the ecosystem is given the opportunity to recover and adapt to its new environment, which may include changes in the types of organisms that can survive and thrive in the area.\n\nOption (B) undergo ecosystem progression is incorrect because the removal of waste does not necessarily lead to a progression or improvement in the ecosystem's overall health and functioning.\n\nOption (C) return to its pre-pollution conditions is incorrect because the ecosystem may not be able to return to its pre-pollution conditions, especially if the pollution has caused long-term damage.\n\nOption (D) produce organisms that can survive changed conditions is incorrect because the removal of waste is not necessarily focused on producing organisms that can survive changed conditions, but rather on allowing the ecosystem to recover and adapt to its new environment.",
  "arc_144": "The correct answer is (B) Both the salt and the water evaporate and leave the beaker. When salt water is boiled, both the water and the salt will evaporate and leave the beaker. This is because the boiling point of water is 100°C (212°F), which is higher than the melting point of salt (60°C or 140°F). Therefore, when salt water is heated to the boiling point, the water will evaporate first, followed by the salt.",
  "arc_147": "The correct answer is (A) a folded chain of amino acids. Proteins are complex biomolecules made up of one or more chains of amino acids that are folded into a specific three-dimensional structure. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and the sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its three-dimensional structure and function. Therefore, option (A) is the correct description of protein.",
  "arc_148": "Based on scientific facts and knowledge, the correct answer is (A) Algae grows rapidly. Excess nitrogen in ponds and lakes can lead to an overgrowth of algae, which can deplete the oxygen in the water and create \"dead zones\" where fish and other organisms cannot survive. This can have a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, impacting the food chain and the overall health of the pond or lake.",
  "arc_151": "The correct answer is (B) slower than its revolution.\n\nThe Moon's rotation is actually slower than its revolution around the Earth. The Moon takes about 27.3 days to complete one rotation on its axis, while it takes about 29.5 days to complete one orbit around the Earth. This means that the Moon's rotation is slower than its revolution by about 2.2 days.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_152": "The correct answer is (A) air.\n\nAir is the best conductor of electricity among the options provided. This is because air is a gas and gases are better conductors of electricity than solids or liquids. In fact, air is one of the best conductors of electricity in its class, with a conductivity that is about 30% of the conductivity of copper.\n\nGlass, water, and wood are not good conductors of electricity. Glass is an insulator, meaning it does not conduct electricity well, if at all. Water is a poor conductor of electricity due to its high resistance to the flow of electrons. Wood is also a poor conductor of electricity due to its high resistance and lack of conductive properties.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) air.",
  "arc_154": "The correct answer is (C) kinetic energy.\n\nAs the stuntman jumps off the roof and falls towards the airbag, his kinetic energy (the energy of motion) increases. This is because the stuntman's velocity (the speed at which he is moving) increases as he falls. The other options do not accurately describe the situation. Gravity (option (A)) is the force that pulls the stuntman towards the ground, but it does not directly affect the stuntman's kinetic energy. Wind velocity (option (B)) may affect the stuntman's motion, but it does not increase the stuntman's kinetic energy as he falls towards the airbag. Potential energy (option (D)) is the energy an object has due to its height or position, but it is not directly related to the stuntman's kinetic energy as he falls.",
  "arc_156": "The correct answer is (C) rigidity.\n\nOrganisms are living things, and as such, they have certain characteristics that are common to all living things. These characteristics include the ability to grow, reproduce, and respond to stimuli. However, rigidity is not a characteristic common to all organisms. While some organisms may have a rigid structure, such as bones or shells, others may be flexible and able to change shape.\n\nTherefore, option (C) rigidity is not a characteristic common to all organisms. The other options, (A) requires energy, (B) reproduction, and (D) presence of DNA, are all characteristics that are common to all living things.",
  "arc_158": "The correct answer is (B) gravity.\n\nThe Moon is in orbit around Earth due to the gravitational force exerted by the Earth. The Moon's gravity is also attracted to the Earth, but it is not strong enough to overcome the Earth's gravitational pull, which keeps the Moon in its orbit. The other options, friction, weight, and rotation, do not play a significant role in keeping the Moon in its orbit.",

  "arc_162": "The correct answer is (A) electrons, neutrons, and protons.\n\nAn atom is made up of three main parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons are positively charged particles that reside in the nucleus of an atom, while neutrons have no charge and also reside in the nucleus. Electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because gamma rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation and do not make up a part of an atom.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because photons are also a type of electromagnetic radiation and do not make up a part of an atom.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because alpha particles are made up of two protons and two neutrons, and do not make up a part of an atom.",
  "arc_163": "The correct answer is (C) triglycerides.\n\nDuring digestion, fructose is produced by the breakdown of larger molecules, such as triglycerides, which are found in fats and oils. When triglycerides are broken down in the digestive system, they release fructose molecules, which can then be absorbed and used by the body for energy or stored for later use.\n\nProteins (option (A)), vitamins (option (B)), and carbohydrates (option (D)) are not broken down to increase fructose levels in the body. Proteins are broken down into smaller peptides and amino acids, which can be used to build and repair tissues, while vitamins and carbohydrates are not broken down to produce fructose.",
  "arc_164": "The correct answer is (C) The frequency of the sound is too high.\n\nThe frequency of a sound is the number of vibrations or oscillations per second, and it is measured in Hertz (Hz). The frequency of the sound made by Elizabeth's whistle is too high for humans to hear because the range of frequencies that humans can hear is typically between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. The frequency of the whistle is likely above this range, making it inaudible to humans.\n\nThe other options are not correct explanations for why humans cannot hear the sound made by the whistle:\n\n* (A) The speed of the sound is not a factor in whether or not it can be heard by humans. The speed of a sound wave does not affect its frequency or whether it can be heard by a particular species.\n* (B) The amplitude of the sound is also not a factor in whether or not it can be heard by humans. The amplitude of a sound wave refers to its loudness, but it does not determine whether a sound can be heard by a particular species.\n* (D) The wavelength of a sound wave is not a factor in whether or not it can be heard by humans. The wavelength of a sound wave refers to the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of the wave, but it does not determine whether a sound can be heard by a particular species.",
  "arc_166": "The correct answer is (A) Pacific Plate. The United States is located on the North American Plate, which is part of the Pacific Plate. The Pacific Plate is one of the major tectonic plates that make up the Earth's surface, and it is responsible for the geological features of the western United States, including the Rocky Mountains and the San Andreas Fault.",
  "arc_168": "The correct answer is (C) the gravitational field of the Moon is less than that of Earth.\n\nThe force required to launch a spaceship from the surface of the Moon is less than the force required to launch an identical ship from the surface of Earth because the Moon has a weaker gravitational field than Earth. The strength of the gravitational field is determined by the mass of the celestial body and the distance between the object and the center of the body. Since the Moon has a much smaller mass than Earth, its gravitational field is weaker, requiring less force to launch a spaceship from its surface.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the surface area of the Moon is not smaller than that of Earth.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the mass of an object on Earth is not greater than on the Moon. In fact, the mass of the Moon is much smaller than the mass of Earth.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the atmosphere of the Moon is not much thinner than that of Earth. The Moon has a very thin atmosphere, but it is not significantly thinner than the atmosphere of Earth.",

  "arc_175": "The correct answer is (D) a white dwarf star.\n\nThe Sun is a main-sequence star, which means that it is in the middle of its life cycle and will eventually run out of fuel. As the Sun burns through its hydrogen fuel, it will expand to become a red giant, and then shed its outer layers to form a white dwarf star. This process is expected to occur in about 5 billion years. Therefore, the Sun is most likely to become a white dwarf star at the end of its lifetime.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* (A) a protostar is a very early stage in the formation of a star, and the Sun is not in this stage.\n* (B) a black hole is a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light, can escape. The Sun will not become a black hole because it does not have enough mass to form a black hole.\n* (C) a neutron star is a type of star that is formed when a massive star undergoes a supernova explosion. The Sun is not massive enough to form a neutron star.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
  "arc_176": "The correct answer is (B) pushing on a wall.\n\nWork is defined as the product of force and distance. When you push on a wall, you are applying a force to it over a distance, which means that you are doing work on the wall. The other options do not involve the application of force over a distance, so they are not examples of work.\n\nSitting at a desk (option (A)) does not involve any force or distance, so it is not a example of work.\n\nRiding a bike (option (C)) involves the application of force over a distance, but the force is not applied directly to an object, so it is not an example of work in the classical sense.\n\nReading a book (option (D)) does not involve the application of force or distance, so it is not an example of work.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) pushing on a wall.",

  "arc_183": "The correct answer is (A) Millions of years ago, Antarctica was in a warmer location on Earth.\n\nThe discovery of fossils of tropical fern plants in Antarctica suggests that Antarctica was once in a warmer location on Earth. This is because ferns are typically found in tropical regions, and their presence in Antarctica indicates that the continent was once closer to the equator. This is supported by geological evidence, such as the presence of tropical rocks and sediments in Antarctica, which suggests that the continent was once part of a larger landmass that was located closer to the equator.\n\nThe other options do not explain the presence of tropical fern fossils in Antarctica:\n\nOption (B) is unlikely, as there is no evidence of a recent natural disaster killing all of the fern plants in Antarctica.\n\nOption (C) is also unlikely, as there is no evidence of birds stopping the transportation of fern seeds to Antarctica.\n\nOption (D) is not supported by scientific evidence, as the Earth's south pole has not changed significantly in temperature over millions of years.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Millions of years ago, Antarctica was in a warmer location on Earth.",
  "arc_186": "The correct answer is (B) spring.\n\nThe Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun during the spring season. As the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the Sun, the Sun's rays hit the Earth at a more oblique angle, resulting in longer days and warmer temperatures. This is why spring is the season when the Northern Hemisphere is pointed away from the Sun.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n* Fall is the season when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, resulting in shorter days and cooler temperatures.\n* Summer is the season when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, resulting in longer days and warmer temperatures.\n* Winter is the season when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, resulting in shorter days and colder temperatures.",

These three things are essential for an animal's survival. Soil, light, and light are not necessary for an animal's survival. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect. Option (B) is also incorrect because while light is important for some animals, it is not a necessary component for all animals to survive. Option (D) is incorrect because while light is important for some animals, it is not a necessary component for an animal's survival.",
  "arc_194": "The correct answer is (C) The amount of air pollution is reduced.\n\nTurning plant material into fuel can help reduce air pollution in several ways:\n\n1. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: Burning plant material instead of fossil fuels can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, which contribute to climate change.\n2. Lower emissions of harmful pollutants: Plant-based fuels typically emit fewer harmful pollutants, such as particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, compared to fossil fuels.\n3. Reduced dependence on fossil fuels: By using plant material as a fuel source, we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, which are finite resources that are being depleted at an alarming rate.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is the most likely benefit of turning plant material into fuel.",

  "arc_198": "The correct answer is (B) melts.\n\nSnow turns to liquid water when it melts. This process occurs when the temperature of the snow exceeds the freezing point of water, which is 32°F (0°C) at sea level. As the temperature of the snow increases, the water molecules inside the snow crystals begin to move more quickly and gain kinetic energy, eventually breaking the bonds that hold the crystals together and causing the snow to melt.\n\nThe other options are not correct explanations for how snow turns to liquid water:\n\n* (A) freezes: Snow does not turn to liquid water when it freezes. Freezing occurs when the temperature of a substance drops below its freezing point, at which point the substance will begin to solidify.\n* (C) condenses: Condensation occurs when a substance changes from a gas to a liquid. Snow does not turn to liquid water through condensation, as it is already a solid when it falls from the sky.\n* (D) evaporates: Evaporation occurs when a substance changes from a liquid to a gas. Snow does not turn to liquid water through evaporation, as it is already a solid when it falls from the sky.",

  "arc_200": "The correct answer is (B) oceans and the Sun.\n\nIn the water cycle, the Sun is the primary source of energy that drives the evaporation of water from the oceans, lakes, and other bodies of water. This process is known as evaporation, and it is the first step in the water cycle. The Sun's energy heats the water, causing it to change from a liquid to a gas, which rises into the atmosphere as water vapor.\n\nTherefore, option (B) oceans and the Sun is the correct answer.",
  "arc_201": "The correct answer is (C) There is greater precipitation.\n\nWinds blowing inland from oceans tend to have greater moisture than winds blowing over land because the ocean evaporates water vapor into the atmosphere, which is then carried by the winds to the coastal area. This increased moisture content leads to greater precipitation in the coastal area, as the water vapor in the air condenses and forms clouds, resulting in more rainfall. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_202": "The correct answer is (C) It enter storm drains and contaminates surface water.\n\nUsed motor oil is not insoluble and difficult to clean up, as it can dissolve in water and cause acid rain (B).

Therefore, the only option that is not associated with the disposal of used motor oil from cars is (C) It enter storm drains and contaminates surface water.",
  "arc_204": "The correct answer is (C) Ecosystems with few species are weak and unstable.\n\nA terrarium is a closed environment that mimics a natural ecosystem, typically containing plants, animals, and microorganisms. However, creating a terrarium ecosystem that can last a long time without human help is challenging due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Limited species diversity: A terrarium with few species is more prone to instability and fragility. When there are fewer species, the ecosystem is more susceptible to changes in temperature, humidity, and light, which can disrupt the balance of the ecosystem.\n2. Lack of nutrient cycling: In a terrarium with few species, nutrients may become depleted more quickly, leading to a decline in plant and animal health. Without a diverse range of species to contribute to nutrient cycling, the ecosystem may struggle to maintain itself.\n3. Inadequate oxygen supply: While oxygen is essential for the survival of most living organisms, a terrarium with few species may not be able to provide enough oxygen for all the organisms within. This can lead to oxygen deficiency and stress on the organisms, making them more susceptible to disease and mortality.\n4. Inability to adapt to changing conditions: A terrarium with few species may not be able to adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature or humidity. This can lead to a decline in the ecosystem's overall health and stability.\n\nTherefore, option (C) Ecosystems with few species are weak and unstable is the correct answer.",
  "arc_206": "The correct answer is (A) heavier rainfall.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn regions where prevailing winds blow from the oceans to the shore, the moisture-laden air from the ocean is likely to result in heavier rainfall. This is because the water vapor in the ocean air condenses and releases its moisture as rainfall when it encounters cooler land masses. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely to occur in such regions.\n\nOption (B) dryer conditions is incorrect because the prevailing winds blowing from the oceans to the shore are likely to result in humid conditions, rather than dryer conditions.\n\nOption (C) cold temperatures is incorrect because the temperature of the air does not necessarily determine the amount of rainfall. While cold air can hold more moisture than warm air, the amount of rainfall is primarily determined by the amount of moisture in the air, rather than the temperature.\n\nOption (D) frequent hurricanes is incorrect because hurricanes are tropical cyclones that form over warm ocean waters and are not directly related to the prevailing winds blowing from the oceans to the shore. While hurricanes can bring heavy rainfall to coastal areas, they are not the most likely outcome in regions where prevailing winds blow from the oceans to the shore.",
  "arc_208": "The correct answer is (A) the ability to revolve around the central ball.\n\nGiselle's model of a solar eclipse should have the ability to revolve around the central ball to accurately represent the phenomenon of a solar eclipse. During a solar eclipse, the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun's light and causing the Moon's shadow to revolve around the central point of the Sun. By having the foam balls revolve around the central ball, Giselle's model can effectively demonstrate this phenomenon.\n\nOption (B) a magnet in each ball is not relevant to the modeling of a solar eclipse.\n\nOption (C) a representation of oceans on each ball is not a characteristic of a solar eclipse.\n\nOption (D) a source of thermal energy is not a characteristic of a solar eclipse. Thermal energy is related to the temperature of an object or system, and is not directly related to the phenomenon of a solar eclipse.",
  "arc_213": "The correct answer is (A) Slow changes allow time for adaptation.\n\nRapidly occurring environmental changes are more likely to cause extinctions than slowly occurring changes because they do not give organisms enough time to adapt and evolve to the new conditions. Adaptation is the process by which organisms become better suited to their environment, and it typically occurs over many generations. If environmental changes occur too quickly, organisms may not have enough time to adapt and may be unable to keep up with the changing conditions.\n\nIn contrast, slowly occurring changes give organisms more time to adapt and evolve. For example, if sea levels are rising gradually over many years, organisms living in coastal areas may have time to migrate inland or adapt to the changing environment in other ways. Similarly, if temperatures are changing slowly over many years, organisms may have time to adjust their behavior or physiology to cope with the changing conditions.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct answer.",

  "arc_217": "To determine the probability that one of the children will have blue eyes, we need to use the principles of genetics.\n\nBlue eyes are a dominant trait, meaning that if one parent has blue eyes, all of their offspring will inherit the gene for blue eyes. Brown eyes, on the other hand, are a recessive trait, meaning that if one parent has brown eyes, their offspring will only inherit the gene for brown eyes if they also inherit the gene for blue eyes from the other parent.\n\nGiven that one parent has brown eyes (BB) and the other parent has blue eyes (bb), there are two possible combinations of genes that their offspring could inherit:\n\n1. BB x BB = Brown eyes (recessive)\n2. Bb x Bb = Brown eyes (recessive)\n3. BB x bb = Blue eyes (dominant)\n4. Bb x BB = Blue eyes (dominant)\n\nSince blue eyes are a dominant trait, there is a 50% chance that one of the children will inherit the gene for blue eyes (either BB x BB or Bb x BB). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 50%.\n\nSo, the probability that one of the children will have blue eyes is 50%.",
  "arc_221": "The correct answer is (B) Al_{2}O_{3}.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAn aluminum ion has a charge of +3, which means it has three positive charges. An oxide ion has a charge of -2, which means it has two negative charges. When these two ions react, they form a compound called aluminum oxide (Al_{2}O_{3}).\n\nTherefore, the product of a reaction between an aluminum ion and an oxide ion is Al_{2}O_{3}.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* (A) Al_{2}O is not the product of a reaction between an aluminum ion and an oxide ion. Aluminum oxide has a charge of +2, which is different from the charges of the aluminum ion and the oxide ion.\n* (C) 2AlO_{3} is not the product of a reaction between an aluminum ion and an oxide ion. This compound has a charge of +6, which is different from the charges of the aluminum ion and the oxide ion.\n* (D) Al_{3}O_{2} is not the product of a reaction between an aluminum ion and an oxide ion. This compound has a charge of +6, which is different from the charges of the aluminum ion and the oxide ion.",
  "arc_222": "The correct answer is (C) evaporation.\n\nEvaporation is the process by which liquid water changes into water vapor. It occurs when the temperature of the liquid water is increased, allowing the water molecules to transition from a liquid to a gas state. This process is a fundamental aspect of the water cycle and is essential for the Earth's climate and weather patterns.\n\nThe other options are not correct explanations for the process of liquid water changing into water vapor:\n\n* Condensation is the process by which water vapor changes into liquid water. This occurs when the temperature of the air is cooled, causing the water vapor to condense into droplets of water.\n* Transportation refers to the movement of water from one location to another, often through the process of evaporation and condensation. However, this is not the process by which liquid water changes into water vapor.\n* Accumulation refers to the buildup of water in a particular location, such as a puddle or a lake. While water can accumulate through various means, including evaporation, it is not the process by which liquid water changes into water vapor.",

By putting some Quickgrow on one group of plants and some Supergrow on another group of plants of the same type, Pat can directly compare the growth of the two groups. By placing all the plants in the same place, Pat can ensure that the only difference between the groups is the type of plant food they have been treated with. This will provide the most accurate comparison of the two plant foods and help Pat determine which one helps the houseplant grow the most.\n\nOption (A) is not the best approach because it does not provide a fair comparison between the two plant foods. By putting some Quickgrow on a plant in the living room and some Supergrow on a plant of the same type in the bedroom, Pat is not controlling for any other variables that could affect plant growth, such as light levels, temperature, and humidity.\n\nOption (B) is not the best approach because it does not take into account the cost of the plant food. While it is possible that the more expensive plant food is better for growing plants, it is also possible that the more expensive plant food is simply more expensive for no good reason. By comparing the growth of plants that have been treated with different amounts of each plant food, Pat can determine which plant food is most effective without worrying about the cost.\n\nOption",

If the slide shatters, the student should not attempt to collect the specimen from the broken pieces, as this could potentially damage the specimen further. Instead, the student should attempt to collect the specimen from the slide pieces using a gentle and careful method, such as using a pair of tweezers or a small brush. This will help to minimize the risk of damaging the specimen and ensure that it can be properly examined under the microscope.\n\nThe other options are not appropriate procedures for handling a broken microscope slide. Option (B) picking up the larger pieces of the slide is not a recommended method, as it could potentially damage the specimen or introduce contaminants into the slide. Option (C) using a broom to sweep up all the glass on the floor is not a suitable solution, as it could damage the specimen and create a hazardous situation.

Plateaus are formed through a variety of geological processes, including erosion, weathering, and tectonic uplift. Of the options provided, erosion of rock debris is the most likely mechanism for forming a plateau.\n\nRunoff from a river (option A) is not a significant factor in forming plateaus, as plateaus are typically located far from rivers and other bodies of water. Weathering by waves (option B) can also play a role in forming plateaus, but it is not the primary mechanism. A buildup of cooled lava (option D) is not a common way for plateaus to form, as plateaus are typically formed through the erosion and uplift of existing rock formations.",
  "arc_239": "The best answer is (B) Repeat the same experiment several times.\n\nTo prove that the results of an experiment are reliable, it's important to repeat the experiment multiple times to ensure consistency and minimize the impact of any external factors. By repeating the experiment several times, the student can gather more data and increase the reliability of their results. This is especially important when testing a hypothesis related to static electricity, as this phenomenon can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as humidity, temperature, and air currents.\n\nWriting down the results of the experiment (Option A) is also important, as it allows the student to document their findings and share them with others. However, this alone may not be enough to prove the reliability of the results, as it's possible for errors or inconsistencies to occur during data collection.\n\nMaking another hypothesis about static electricity (Option C) is not the best approach, as it would not help to prove the reliability of the original experiment. Conducting a different static electricity experiment (Option D) could potentially provide additional information, but it would not address the reliability of the original experiment.",

Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. It works by binding to insulin receptors on the surface of cells, particularly in the liver, muscles, and adipose tissue. This binding triggers a cascade of cellular signaling events that ultimately lead to the uptake of glucose by cells, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. Therefore, option (A) best describes the function of insulin.",
  "arc_241": "The correct answer is (B) a neutron.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAn atom is made up of three main parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus of the atom, while electrons orbit the nucleus. If an atom were to lose mass, it would be due to the loss of one or more neutrons. Neutrons have a slightly larger mass than protons, so losing a neutron would result in the least amount of mass loss for the atom.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because protons have a much smaller mass than neutrons, so losing a proton would result in a much larger mass loss for the atom.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the nucleus is the central part of the atom where the protons and neutrons are found, and it cannot be lost.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus of the atom, and they cannot be lost.",

However, volcanoes do not play a significant role in providing energy to the Earth's interior. Convection is also not a significant source of energy in the Earth's interior, as it is primarily responsible for redistributing heat within the atmosphere and oceans.\n\nMolten rock, or magma, is a significant source of energy in the Earth's interior. Magma is molten rock that is beneath the Earth's surface, and it is heated by the decay of radioactive isotopes. As magma rises to the surface, it can produce volcanic eruptions, which release energy in the form of heat, light, and sound. This energy is then released into the environment, contributing to the Earth's overall energy budget.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) molten rock.",

  "arc_253": "The correct answer is (C) pulling force of other planets.\n\nThe Earth's orbit is determined by the gravitational forces exerted by the Sun and the other planets in the solar system. The Sun's mass is the primary source of the gravitational force that keeps the Earth in its orbit. The size of the Moon and the distance between other planets do not have a significant impact on the Earth's orbit.\n\nHere are some scientific facts that support this answer:\n\n1. The Earth's orbit is an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the two foci. This shape is determined by the gravitational force of the Sun and the other planets.\n2. The Earth's distance from the Sun varies throughout the year, with the closest approach (perihelion) occurring in January and the farthest distance (aphelion) occurring in July. This variation in distance affects the strength of the gravitational force acting on the Earth, which in turn affects the shape of its orbit.\n3. The other planets in the solar system, particularly Jupiter and Venus, have a significant gravitational influence on the Earth's orbit. The gravitational force of these planets causes the Earth's orbit to be slightly eccentric, or oval-shaped, rather than a perfect circle.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (C) pulling force of other planets, as the gravitational forces exerted by the Sun and the other planets in the solar system are the primary factors determining the Earth's orbit.",

Similarly, in the case of chicken eggs, the embryo is the developing chick that will hatch into a fully formed chicken.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* (A) pupa is the stage of development where an insect transforms from a larva to an adult.\n* (B) fetus is the stage of development where a mammal is developing inside its mother's womb.\n* (D) adult is the stage of development where an organism has reached full maturity and is capable of reproducing.",
  "arc_258": "The correct answer is (A) Check the bread each day.\n\nMold growth on bread is a slow process, typically taking several days to a week or more, depending on factors such as temperature, humidity, and the type of bread. To accurately measure the time it takes for mold to form on bread, the student should check the bread each day to observe any visible signs of mold growth. This will provide the most accurate and reliable data for the investigation.\n\nOption (B) Record the temperature of the bread is not relevant to the investigation, as mold growth is not affected by temperature.\n\nOption (C) Measure the weight of the bread is not relevant to the investigation, as mold growth does not affect the weight of the bread.\n\nOption (D) Give the bread different amounts of light is not relevant to the investigation, as mold growth is not affected by light exposure.",
  "arc_259": "The correct answer is (A) The old hypothesis will become obsolete.\n\nThe new evidence suggests that our solar system may have formed when short-lived, massive stars in a nebula exploded. This contradicts the traditional hypothesis that our solar system formed from a slowly condensing cloud of dust and gas. Therefore, the old hypothesis will become obsolete as the new evidence provides a more plausible explanation for the formation of our solar system.",
  "arc_260": "The correct answer is (A) slower.\n\nWhen a toy truck rolls over a smooth surface, it will experience a force known as friction. Friction is the resistance that occurs when an object moves over a surface. When the surface is covered with sand, the frictional force increases, causing the truck to slow down. Therefore, the truck will most likely roll slower on a surface covered with sand compared to a smooth surface.",
  "arc_261": "The correct answer is (A) 24 hours. The period of rotation for each planet in our solar system is different, and Earth's period of rotation is 24 hours, which is the length of time it takes for the planet to rotate once on its axis. The other options are not correct:\n\n* (B) 28 days is the length of time it takes for Mercury to rotate once on its axis.\n* (C) 13 weeks is the length of time it takes for Venus to rotate once on its axis.\n* (D) 1 year is the length of time it takes for Jupiter to rotate once on its axis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 24 hours.",
  "arc_264": "The correct answer is (C) The total mass remains the same.\n\nWhen a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen is ignited in a test tube, the reaction is:\n\nHydrogen + Oxygen -> Water + Energy\n\nDuring this reaction, the mass of the hydrogen and oxygen is converted into the mass of water and energy. Since the mass of the water is greater than the mass of the hydrogen and oxygen, the total mass of the contents of the test tube remains the same. Therefore, the answer is (C) The total mass remains the same.",
  "arc_266": "The correct answer is (C) The Coriolis effect creating a low pressure area.\n\nWhen a town in northern Arkansas experiences colder than normal temperatures during part of the winter, it is likely due to the Coriolis effect, which is the apparent deflection of winds and ocean currents caused by the Earth's rotation. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis effect creates a low pressure area to the east of the area of colder temperatures, which can lead to colder air moving into the area. Therefore, option (C) is the most likely responsible for the colder temperatures in the town.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the information provided:\n\n* Option (A) is incorrect because a southward dip in the jet stream would actually lead to warmer temperatures, not colder.\n* Option (B) is incorrect because a northward movement of the jet stream would also lead to warmer temperatures, not colder.\n* Option (D) is incorrect because the Coriolis effect creates a high pressure area, not a low pressure area, in the Northern Hemisphere.",
  "arc_271": "The correct answer is (B) brain. The brain is the largest organ in the human body, accounting for approximately 1.4% of an adult's total body weight. It is responsible for controlling the body's functions, interpreting sensory information, and facilitating thought, emotion, and behavior. The stomach, skin, and liver are all important organs in the human body, but they are not the largest.",
  "arc_273": "The correct answer is (A): Available energy increases as trophic levels increase.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn an ecosystem, energy from the Sun is transformed into chemical energy through photosynthesis, and this energy is then passed on through the food chain. As organisms move up the trophic level, they have access to more energy. This is because primary consumers, such as herbivores, feed on producers, such as plants, and transfer energy from the primary producer to themselves. Secondary consumers, such as carnivores, feed on primary consumers and transfer energy from the primary consumer to themselves. Tertiary consumers, such as apex predators, feed on secondary consumers and transfer energy from the secondary consumer to themselves. As a result, the energy available to organisms increases as they move up the trophic level.\n\nTherefore, option (A) best describes the availability of energy for organisms in different trophic levels. Option (B) is incorrect because available energy decreases as trophic levels increase. Option (C) is incorrect because primary consumers do not have the least energy available. Option (D) is incorrect because tertiary consumers do not have the most energy available.",
  "arc_275": "The correct answer is (C) general climate. The description provided in the question best describes the overall climate of the region, including its warm summers and moderate winters, rather than the current weather or weather forecast, which would provide more specific information about the region's weather conditions at a particular moment in time. Additionally, the description does not provide information about climate changes, which is a broader topic that encompasses long-term patterns and trends in weather and climate.",
  "arc_276": "The correct answer is (C) Earth has oceans that store heat.\n\nEarth's surface is not becoming colder because of the oceans' ability to store heat. The oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface and have a high heat capacity, meaning they can absorb and store a significant amount of heat energy without a large change in temperature. This heat is then distributed throughout the ocean through a process called convection, where warmer water rises and cooler water sinks, helping to regulate the Earth's climate.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because while Earth does take in more heat from the Sun, this additional heat is not enough to counteract the heat that is lost to space through radiation.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because while forests do provide some heat through photosynthesis, this heat is not enough to significantly affect the Earth's overall temperature.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because molten lava is not a significant source of heat for the Earth's surface.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Earth has oceans that store heat.",
  "arc_278": "The correct answer is (C) amount of material carried downstream.\n\nAs stream velocity decreases, the friction between the water and the stream bed decreases, which allows the water to carry more material downstream. This means that the amount of material carried by the stream will increase as the stream velocity decreases.\n\nOption (A) erosion of the stream bank is incorrect because as stream velocity decreases, the water will have less energy to erode the stream bank.\n\nOption (B) deposition of material in the stream is incorrect because as stream velocity decreases, the water will have less energy to transport and deposit material in the stream.\n\nOption (D) size of the particles carried downstream is irrelevant to the question, as the size of the particles does not affect the amount of material carried downstream.",
  "arc_282": "The most accurate way to determine the strongest span design for the bridges built using ice cream sticks and glue is option (A) roll toy cars across each bridge until it collapses.\n\nThis is because rolling toy cars across the bridge applies a consistent and controlled load to the structure, which allows for a more accurate assessment of its strength. By observing how the bridge behaves under this load, you can determine its maximum capacity and identify any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in its design.\n\nThe other options are not as accurate or reliable for determining the strongest span design:\n\n* Option (B) placing concrete construction blocks on top of each bridge until it collapses is not a fair test of the bridge's strength, as it does not apply a consistent load to the structure. The weight of the blocks may not be evenly distributed across the bridge, which could lead to inaccurate results.\n* Option (C) stacking coins on both ends of each bridge until it collapses is not a reliable test of the bridge's strength, as the weight of the coins may not be evenly distributed across the bridge. Additionally, the coins may not provide a consistent load to the structure, which could lead to inaccurate results.\n* Option (D) placing D-cell batteries at the center of each bridge until it collapses is not a practical or safe test of the bridge's strength. The batteries may be too heavy for the bridge to support, and could potentially cause damage to the structure or injury to the person conducting the test.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate way to determine the strongest span design for the bridges built using ice cream sticks and glue is to roll toy cars across each bridge until it collapses.",
  "arc_284": "The correct answer is (B) Temperatures increase.\n\nWhen a warm, moist air mass collides with a strong cold air mass, the warm air is forced to rise, resulting in convection and the formation of clouds. As the warm air rises, it cools, and the temperature decreases. Therefore, the temperature will increase as the warm air mass moves northward and collides with the cold air mass moving southward.\n\nOption (A) Thick fog develops is incorrect because fog forms when the air is cool and saturated with water vapor. In this scenario, the air is warm and dry, so fog is not likely to form.\n\nOption (C) Clouds begin to form is incorrect because clouds form when water vapor in the air condenses onto tiny particles in the atmosphere, such as dust, salt, or pollen. In this scenario, the warm air is not saturated with water vapor, so clouds are not likely to form.\n\nOption (D) Winds die down is incorrect because the collision between the warm and cold air masses will cause the winds to increase, not decrease.",
  "arc_286": "The correct answer is (C) Cricket.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAn invertebrate is an animal that does not have a backbone or vertebral column. Crickets are insects and do not have a backbone, making them invertebrates. Squirrels, sea gulls, and lizards are all vertebrates, which means they have a backbone or vertebral column. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Cricket.",
  "arc_287": "Based on scientific facts and reasoning, the correct answer is (B) It will continue to increase steadily from year to year.\n\nWhen predators are eliminated from a population, the prey population can experience a temporary increase due to the lack of predation pressure. However, without predators to regulate their numbers, the prey population will continue to grow unchecked, leading to overgrazing and degradation of the environment. This can result in a cycle of overpopulation, where the population grows beyond the carrying capacity of the environment, leading to a decline in the population.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the birth rate does not necessarily equal the death rate in the absence of predators. The population can continue to grow as the birth rate exceeds the death rate, leading to overpopulation.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because other herbivores are not likely to move into the region in response to the elimination of mountain lions and wolves. These predators play a crucial role in regulating the deer population, and their absence will not create a vacuum that other herbivores can fill.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because a decrease in the deer population due to overcrowding is not a likely outcome in the absence of predators. While overcrowding can lead to a decrease in the population, it is more likely that the population will continue to grow unchecked in the absence of predators.",
  "arc_289": "The correct answer is (B) the water in a glass of ice water.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe kinetic energy of a substance is the energy of motion of its particles. The particles within a substance are in constant motion, vibrating and colliding with each other. The amount of kinetic energy depends on the temperature of the substance.\n\nAt room temperature, the particles within a candle have a higher kinetic energy than the particles within a glass of ice water. This is because the particles in the candle are vibrating and colliding more rapidly than the particles in the glass of ice water, due to the higher temperature.\n\nTherefore, option (A) the wax of a candle at room temperature has the highest kinetic energy among the given options.\n\nOn the other hand, the particles within the steam from a cup of coffee have the lowest kinetic energy among the given options. This is because the steam is at a lower temperature than the other options, and therefore the particles within the steam are vibrating and colliding less rapidly than the particles within the other options.\n\nSimilarly, the particles within the ice cube in a glass of tea have a lower kinetic energy than the particles within the other options. This is because the ice cube is at a lower temperature than the other options, and therefore the particles within the ice cube are vibrating and colliding less rapidly than the particles within the other options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) the water in a glass of ice water.",
  "arc_290": "The correct answer is (A) use a new battery. When building an electrical circuit, it is important to use a new battery to ensure that it is functioning properly and will not cause any safety hazards. Wearing rubber gloves (B), cleaning the electrical wire (C), and reading all directions (D) are all important safety precautions to take when building an electrical circuit, but they are not the most important safety precaution to take first.",
  "arc_291": "The correct answer is (A) absorb.\n\nThe tinted lenses of sunglasses absorb UV rays from the Sun, rather than deflecting, reflecting, or refracting them. The tinted lens absorbs UV light by scattering it in all directions, rather than allowing it to pass through the lens and reach the eye. This helps to protect the eye from the harmful effects of UV radiation, such as cataracts, macular degeneration, and eye cancer.",
  "arc_293": "The correct answer is (B) A paramecium does not photosynthesize its own food.\n\nEuglena is a eukaryotic microorganism that can photosynthesize its own food, while Paramecium is a prokaryotic microorganism that does not have the ability to photosynthesize. Therefore, Paramecium does not need an eyespot to detect light, as it does not rely on photosynthesis for its nutrition.\n\nThe other options are not correct explanations for why a paramecium does not need an eyespot:\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because Paramecium can be found in a variety of environments, including those with light, so it is not accurate to say that it does not live where there is light.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because Paramecium can be found in both shallow and deep water, so it is not accurate to say that it lives in shallower water than Euglena.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because Paramecium uses cilia for movement, not a flagellum, so it is not accurate to say that it uses cilia instead of a flagellum to move.",
  "arc_294": "The correct answer is (B) states of matter.\n\nGases can be easily compressed and expand to fill their containers because they are in a state of matter known as a gas. Gases are characterized by their ability to expand and fill their containers, and they can be compressed and stored in a small space. This is a fundamental property of gases, and it is not a change in state or a property of matter.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* (A) changes in state refer to changes in the physical state of a substance, such as from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. While gases can change state, the description provided does not refer to a change in state.\n* (C) properties of matter refer to the characteristics of a substance that do not change, such as its color, odor, or density. The ability of gases to expand and fill their containers is a property of matter, but it is not the same as the description provided.\n* (D) changes in properties refer to changes in the characteristics of a substance that are not related to its state of matter. For example, the boiling point of a substance can change depending on the pressure, but this is not related to the state of matter.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) states of matter.",
  "arc_299": "The correct answer is (B) the position.\n\nThe velocity of an object is a measure of its rate of change of position with respect to time. It is defined as the displacement of the object per unit time. The velocity of an object can change without changing its position, for example, if the object is moving in a circular path, its velocity remains constant, but its position changes as it moves around the circular path.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_301": "The correct answer is (B) reaches deep into Earth. Geothermal energy is produced when heat from the Earth's interior is used to generate electricity. This heat is typically found in areas where the Earth's crust is thick and hot, such as near volcanoes or underground hot springs. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_302": "The correct answer is (A) glass.\n\nGlass is the best heat insulator due to its low thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity is the ability of a material to transfer heat energy, and glass has one of the lowest thermal conductivity values of any material. This means that very little heat energy is transferred through glass, making it an excellent insulator. In contrast, metals, water, and wood have higher thermal conductivity values and are not as effective at insulating against heat.",
  "arc_303": "The correct answer is (C) burning of fossil fuels. The depletion of the ozone layer is primarily caused by the release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other halogenated gases into the atmosphere through human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels. CFCs and other halogenated gases are potent greenhouse gases that contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer by increasing the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the Earth's surface.\n\nBuilding hydroelectric plants, runoff from fertilized farm fields, and the release of chlorofluorocarbons from aerosol cans are not significant contributors to the depletion of the ozone layer. While hydroelectric plants and fertilized farm fields can have environmental impacts, they are not directly related to the depletion of the ozone layer. The release of chlorofluorocarbons from aerosol cans is also not a significant contributor to the depletion of the ozone layer, as the amount of CFCs released from aerosol cans is relatively small compared to the total amount of CFCs released into the atmosphere through human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels.",
  "arc_305": "The correct answer is (B) Toothed whales descended from baleen whales.\n\nThe information provided in the question states that baleen whales filter plankton from the water using baleen plates, and that the embryos of baleen whales have teeth in their upper jaws. As the embryos develop, the teeth are replaced with baleen. This suggests that baleen whales evolved from a teeth-bearing ancestor, rather than the other way around.\n\nOption (A) is not supported by the information provided, as there is no evidence that primitive whales had teeth as adults. Option (C) is also not supported, as there is no indication that baleen whales are evolving into toothed whales. Option (D) is unlikely, as the information provided does not suggest that descendants of modern baleen whales will have both teeth and baleen as adults.",
  "arc_308": "To find the mass of the water that evaporated, we need to use the formula:\n\nMass of water = Volume of water x Density of water\n\nIn this case, the volume of water decreased from 150 mL to 148.5 mL, so the volume of water that evaporated is:\n\nVolume of water that evaporated = 148.5 mL - 150 mL = -1.5 mL\n\nSince the density of water is 1.0 g/mL, the mass of water that evaporated is:\n\nMass of water that evaporated = Volume of water that evaporated x Density of water\n= -1.5 mL x 1.0 g/mL = -1.5 grams\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 1.0 g.",
  "arc_311": "The best answer is (B) one sample a day on several rainy days.\n\nBetsy wants to find out if the rainfall in her town contains pollutants, and the best way to gather information on this topic is to collect samples on multiple rainy days. This is because pollutants can be present in the air and water during different times of the year and under different weather conditions, including rainfall. By collecting samples on multiple rainy days, Betsy can get a more comprehensive picture of the types and amounts of pollutants present in the rainfall in her town.\n\nOption (A) collecting one sample on one rainy day is not sufficient because it may not capture the variability of pollutants in the rainfall over time. Option (C) collecting several separate samples on one rainy day is also not the best approach because it may not provide a representative sample of the rainfall in the town. Option (D) collecting several separate samples on several rainy days is a good approach, but it may be more time-consuming and resource-intensive than collecting samples on multiple rainy days.",
  "arc_312": "The correct answer is (C) a definite weight.\n\nAll matter has two fundamental characteristics: mass and volume. Mass is the amount of matter in an object, and volume is the amount of space occupied by the object. These characteristics are inherent to matter and cannot be changed by external factors.\n\nTherefore, option (C) a definite weight is the correct answer, as all matter has a definite weight, regardless of its size or shape.\n\nOption (A) mass is also correct, as all matter has mass.\n\nOption (B) color is not a characteristic of matter, as color is a property of light and does not describe the inherent properties of matter.\n\nOption (D) a definite shape is not a characteristic of matter, as matter can take on various shapes depending on its size and shape.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) a definite weight.",
  "arc_313": "The correct answer is (C) The balloons will come together.\n\nWhen two positively charged balloons are brought close to each other, they will attract each other due to the transfer of static electricity. This is because positively charged objects have an excess of electrons, which are attracted to negatively charged objects. As a result, the balloons will move towards each other and stick together.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because bringing two positively charged balloons close to each other will not cause them to move apart.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because bringing two positively charged balloons close to each other will not cause one balloon to lose its charge.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because bringing two positively charged balloons close to each other will not cause one balloon to gain a negative charge.",

This platform allows for easy accessibility and dissemination of information, and it can also provide a permanent record of the findings that can be referenced by other scientists in the future.\n\nOption (A) may not be the best choice as it may not reach a wide audience of scientists who are interested in nerve research. Calling other scientists who also work in nerve research may not be the most efficient way to communicate the findings, as they may not be actively looking for new treatments for nerve damage.\n\nOption (B) may also not be the best choice as it may not reach a scientific audience. Writing a letter to hospitals that treat patients with nerve damage may not be an effective way to communicate the findings to the scientific community, as hospitals may not have the necessary expertise or resources to evaluate the scientific validity of the findings.\n\nOption (D) is also not the best choice as it may not be the most efficient way to communicate the findings to the scientific community. Publishing the results in a scientific journal that covers issues relating to nerves may take a long time, and it may not reach a wide audience of scientists who are interested in nerve research.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way for the scientist to communicate her results to the scientific community is to put them on a Web site that focuses on the nervous system.

  "arc_325": "The correct answer is (A): The volume of the submerged ice is equal to the volume of water displaced.\n\nWhen five ice cubes are placed in a partially filled glass of water, the level of the water will increase because the volume of the submerged ice is equal to the volume of water displaced. The volume of the ice cubes is equal to the volume of the water they displace, so the total volume of water in the glass will increase by the volume of the ice cubes. Therefore, the level of the water will reach the rim of the glass.\n\nThe other options do not explain the increase in water level:\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the mass of the water in the glass is not necessarily less than the mass of the ice. The mass of the water in the glass is equal to the mass of the ice plus the mass of the water displaced.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the weight of the ice is not necessarily less than the weight of the water in the glass.

Animal cells, on the other hand, do not have a cell nucleus. Instead, their genetic material is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_356": "Great, let's get started!\n\nBased on the information provided in the question, the correct answer is (A) The original substances had different densities.\n\nA mixture is a combination of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. If the substances in the beaker have different densities, it indicates that they are not chemically combined and are therefore a mixture.\n\nOption (B) The contents of the beaker reacted to form a new substance is incorrect because it suggests that the substances in the beaker have undergone a chemical reaction, which would indicate that they are chemically combined and therefore a compound.\n\nOption (C) The original substances had a greater mass than the contents of the beaker is incorrect because it does not provide any information about the nature of the substances in the beaker.\n\nOption (D) The contents of the beaker can be easily separated into the original substances is incorrect because if the substances in the beaker can be easily separated into their original substances, it would indicate that they are not a mixture.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
  "arc_357": "The correct answer is (B) severity of hurricanes per season.\n\nMangrove trees are an important wetland inhabitant, and they are adapted to survive in coastal areas with high levels of salt spray, tides, and storm surges. However, the severity of hurricanes per season is not directly related to the density of the mangrove wetland. Hurricanes can have a devastating impact on mangrove ecosystems, regardless of their density.\n\nThe other options are not accurate limiting factors in mangrove wetlands:\n\n* (A) amount of tannin in the bark: Tannins are compounds found in the bark of some trees, including mangroves, but they are not a limiting factor in mangrove wetlands.\n* (C) number of days of sunlight per year: The amount of sunlight a mangrove wetland receives is not a limiting factor for the growth and survival of mangrove trees.\n* (D) size of stilt-like root systems per tree: The size of the root system of a mangrove tree is not a limiting factor for the growth and survival of the tree in a mangrove wetland.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) severity of hurricanes per season.",
  "arc_359": "The correct answer is (C) A chemical reaction between the water and the food coloring formed a new, light blue compound.\n\nWhen Jo Anne added the blue food coloring to the edge of the water's surface, a chemical reaction occurred between the water and the food coloring. This reaction resulted in the formation of a new, light blue compound that spread throughout the water, causing it to become evenly blue.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because water molecules do not directly hit the food coloring molecules to cause mixing.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because light shining on the surface of the water does not cause the food coloring to mix with the water.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the water interacted with the food coloring in a way that would cause the blue color to fade.",
  "arc_362": "The correct answer is (B) They produce gametes.\n\nBoth Euglena and Paramecium are prokaryotic organisms, which means they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotic cells. As such, they do not undergo binary fission, the process of dividing vertically into two identical daughter cells. Instead, they produce gametes, which are specialized cells that fuse to form a zygote, resulting in the production of a new individual.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_365": "The correct answer is (C) corn that is modified to be resistant to herbicides.\n\nNutrient runoff, including excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can cause algal blooms in waterways. These blooms can deplete the oxygen in the water, leading to the death of aquatic organisms. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be used to reduce the amount of nutrient runoff and prevent algal blooms.\n\nCorn that is modified to be resistant to herbicides can help reduce nutrient runoff by reducing the amount of herbicides used in agriculture. Herbicides, such as glyphosate, can run off into waterways and contribute to algal blooms. By using corn that is resistant to herbicides, farmers can reduce the amount of herbicides used, which can help prevent nutrient runoff and reduce the likelihood of algal blooms.\n\nThe other options are not as effective in reducing nutrient runoff and preventing algal blooms:\n\n* Pigs that are modified to have more fat (Option A) are not directly related to reducing nutrient runoff or preventing algal blooms.\n* Cows that are modified to require less feed (Option B) may help reduce the amount of nutrient runoff by requiring less feed, but this is not a direct solution to preventing algal blooms.\n* Corn that is modified to make its own insecticide (Option D) is not directly related to reducing nutrient runoff or preventing algal blooms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) corn that is modified to be resistant to herbicides.",
  "arc_367": "The correct answer is (B) the nervous system. The nervous system protects the brain from getting bumped by providing a cushioning effect through the meninges, a layer of protective tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.",
  "arc_370": "The correct answer is (C) ride a bike to school.\n\nConserving gasoline is an important aspect of reducing our carbon footprint and promoting sustainability. One of the best ways to conserve gasoline is by reducing the number of trips that require gasoline-powered transportation. Riding a bike to school instead of driving a car can significantly reduce the amount of gasoline consumed, as it eliminates the need for a car trip altogether.\n\nAdditionally, riding a bike can provide numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular fitness, reduced stress levels, and increased exposure to vitamin D from sunlight. It is also a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation compared to driving a car, as it produces no emissions or pollutants.\n\nIn contrast, carpooling, riding a bus, and driving alone to school may not have the same level of environmental benefits as riding a bike. While carpooling and riding a bus can reduce the number of cars on the road and decrease emissions, they still require the use of gasoline-powered vehicles. Driving alone to school, on the other hand, is the least environmentally friendly option, as it results in the highest level of emissions and pollutants.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to conserve gasoline is by riding a bike to school. It is a sustainable, environmentally friendly, and healthy mode of transportation that can help reduce our reliance on gasoline and promote a more sustainable lifestyle.",
  "arc_371": "The correct answer is (A) Earth rotates on its axis.\n\nAs the students enter and leave the building, the position of Scorpio in the sky changes due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis. The Earth rotates from west to east, which means that the position of Scorpio in the sky will change as the students move in and out of the building. Therefore, option (A) is the correct explanation for why Scorpio appears to be in a different location.\n\nThe other options are not correct explanations for why Scorpio appears to be in a different location:\n\n* Option (B) Earth revolves around the sun: The Earth's orbit around the sun does not affect the position of Scorpio in the sky. The position of Scorpio is determined by its distance from the Earth and the tilt of the Earth's axis, not by its orbit around the sun.\n* Option (C) The stars are moving through space: The stars are not moving through space in relation to the Earth. The stars are much farther away than the Earth and are not affected by the Earth's motion.\n* Option (D) The gravity of the moon attracts the stars: The gravity of the moon does not affect the position of Scorpio in the sky. The position of Scorpio is determined by its distance from the Earth and the tilt of the Earth's axis, not by the gravity of the moon.",
  "arc_373": "Based on the information provided, the most likely reason a customer would buy a bus from Company X instead of Company Y is:\n\n(A) to keep the cost of the bus low.\n\nCompany X makes 100 custom buses each year, which means they are producing a smaller quantity of buses compared to Company Y, which makes 10,000 of one type of bus each year. This suggests that Company X may be able to offer lower prices to customers due to their smaller production scale. Customers may be more likely to choose Company X over Company Y if they are looking for a more affordable option.",
  "arc_374": "The correct answer is (C) It interrupts the life cycles of pests.\n\nCrop rotation is an effective pest management method because it interrupts the life cycles of pests. Many pests have complex life cycles that involve multiple stages, such as eggs, larvae, and adults. By rotating different crops each year, farmers can disrupt the life cycles of these pests, making it harder for them to survive and reproduce. This can help reduce the overall pest population and minimize the damage they can cause to crops.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because crop rotation does not allow chemicals to kill more pests. While some pesticides may be used in conjunction with crop rotation, the primary benefit of crop rotation is its ability to disrupt pest life cycles, not to kill more pests.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because crop rotation does not create crops that are pest-resistant. While some crops may have genetic traits that make them less susceptible to certain pests, crop rotation is not a method of creating pest-resistant crops.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because crop rotation does not allow pests to overpopulate. By disrupting the life cycles of pests, crop rotation can help reduce the overall pest population, rather than allowing them to overpopulate.",
  "arc_375": "The correct answer is (C) solute.\n\nExplanation: When sodium chloride (NaCl) is dissolved in distilled water, the sodium chloride molecules (NaCl) dissolve into the water molecules (H2O). Therefore, the water in this situation is the solute, as it is the substance being dissolved. The other options are not correct because:\n\n* (A) reactant refers to a substance that undergoes a chemical reaction, but in this case, there is no chemical reaction occurring.\n* (B) product refers to the result of a chemical reaction, but in this case, there is no reaction occurring.\n* (D) solvent refers to the substance in which a solute dissolves, but in this case, the solvent is water and the solute is sodium chloride.",
  "arc_377": "The correct answer is (A) radio tower. Radio towers are not a pathway for transportation as they are used for broadcasting signals, not for transporting people or objects. The other options, (B) road, (C) runway, and (D) pipeline, are all pathways for transportation.",
  "arc_381": "The correct answer is (B) Design an experiment that tests multiple types of popcorn using repeated trials.\n\nTo determine the type of popcorn that produces the greatest number of popped kernels, it is important to conduct a systematic experiment that compares the performance of different types of popcorn under controlled conditions. This can be done by repeating trials using multiple types of popcorn and measuring the number of popped kernels produced in each trial.\n\nOption (A) is not a feasible method for determining the best type of popcorn, as research articles may not provide enough information to compare the performance of different types of popcorn.\n\nOption (C) is not a reliable method for determining the best type of popcorn, as heating kernels on different types of stoves may not provide consistent results.\n\nOption (D) is not a practical method for determining the best type of popcorn, as it would be difficult to construct a mathematical equation that accurately compares the size and mass of kernels from each type.\n\nTherefore, the best method for determining the type of popcorn that produces the greatest number of popped kernels is to conduct a controlled experiment using repeated trials with multiple types of popcorn.",
  "arc_383": "The correct answer is (C) The Moon has many bodies of liquid water. The Moon does not have any liquid water on its surface, as it is a rocky, airless body that is too cold to support liquid water. The other options are not correct descriptions of a physical characteristic of the Moon: (A) is not true, as the Moon is not made of hot gases; (B) is not true, as the Moon does not have many craters; and (D) is not true, as the Moon does not have the ability to give off its own light.",
  "arc_384": "The correct answer is (C) Plankton release oxygen.\n\nPlankton are tiny organisms that live in the ocean and play a crucial role in the ocean's ecosystem. They are able to take energy from the sun and convert it into food through photosynthesis, which is the process of using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process releases oxygen into the water, which is essential for the survival of many ocean animals, including fish, whales, and other marine mammals. Without the oxygen released by plankton, these animals would not be able to survive in the ocean. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_385": "The correct answer is (A) to generate an electric current.\n\nWhen a bar magnet is moved quickly back and forth in a coil of copper wire, it induces an electric current in the wire due to the magnetic field of the magnet. This is known as electromagnetic induction, and it is the principle behind many electrical devices, including generators, motors, and transformers. Therefore, the device created in this scenario is an electrical generator, which is designed to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.",
  "arc_386": "Based on the information provided, the correct answer is (B) The boy moves farther and faster than the man.\n\nWhen two people push off of each other using their hands, the total momentum of the system is conserved. This means that the momentum of the man and the boy before the push is equal to the momentum of the man and the boy after the push. Since the boy is 25 kg and the man is 60 kg, the boy's momentum is smaller than the man's momentum. Therefore, after the push, the boy will move farther and faster than the man.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the man's momentum is not necessarily greater than the boy's momentum. Option (C) is also incorrect because the total momentum of the system is conserved, which means that the distance traveled by the man and the boy after the push is equal to the distance traveled by them before the push. Option (D) is incorrect because the speed of the man and the boy after the push is not necessarily the same as their speed before the push.",
  "arc_387": "The correct answer is (B) sweating from the skin to lower inner heat levels.\n\nWhen Sean felt the room become cooler, his body responded by sweating to lower his inner heat levels. This is a common response to cold temperatures, as sweating helps to reduce the body's core temperature and maintain homeostasis. Option (A) is incorrect because an increase in cellular respiration would actually increase heat production, rather than help the body adjust to the cooler temperature. Option (C) is also incorrect because opening of the capillaries in the skin to obtain more heat would actually increase heat loss, rather than help the body adjust to the cooler temperature. Option (D) is incorrect because an increase in metabolism would actually increase heat production, rather than help the body adjust to the cooler temperature.",
  "arc_389": "The correct answer is (C) The Sun revolves around Earth. This statement was changed because new information became available in the form of scientific discoveries and observations that revealed the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, rather than the other way around. The concept of a heliocentric solar system, where the Sun is at the center, was first proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century and later confirmed through observations and experiments by scientists such as Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler.",
  "arc_392": "The correct answer is (B) more fertile soils.\n\nFlooding rivers can bring nutrient-rich sediment and organic matter from the surrounding landscape into the river, which can lead to more fertile soils along the riverbanks. This can support the growth of vegetation and provide habitat for aquatic animals.\n\nOption (A) eroded riverbanks is incorrect because flooding can lead to the erosion of riverbanks, which can result in the loss of habitat for aquatic animals and the degradation of soil quality.\n\nOption (C) fewer trees near rivers is incorrect because flooding can actually help to increase the number of trees near rivers by providing a source of nutrients and organic matter that can support the growth of vegetation.\n\nOption (D) less habitat for aquatic animals is incorrect because flooding can provide a temporary increase in habitat for aquatic animals, such as fish and other aquatic organisms, as the floodwaters provide a source of food and shelter.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) more fertile soils.",
  "arc_394": "The correct answer is (A) amoeba.\n\nAmoebas are eukaryotic organisms that do not have a transport system to move nutrients throughout their bodies. Instead, they use their pseudopodia to absorb nutrients from their surroundings. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.\n\nOn the other hand, euglena, skin cells, and bacterial cells all have a transport system to move nutrients throughout their bodies. Euglenas have a flagellum that helps them move and also transport nutrients, while skin cells have a cell membrane that allows them to take in nutrients from their surroundings. Bacterial cells have a cell wall that helps them maintain their shape and also transport nutrients through their cytoplasm. Therefore, options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect.",
  "arc_397": "The correct answer is (A) increased use of fossil fuels.\n\nUsing wood-free paper machines that make paper from materials such as cotton and rice waste does not require the use of wood, which means that the production process does not contribute to deforestation or the depletion of forest resources. However, the production of cotton and rice waste requires energy, which is typically generated by burning fossil fuels, thereby increasing the use of fossil fuels. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_399": "The correct answer is (C) hearing people talking on the other side of a wall.\n\nSound waves can travel through two different types of media: solid and liquid. When sound waves travel through a solid medium, such as air, they can be heard directly. However, when sound waves travel through a liquid medium, such as water or a pool, they can travel through the liquid and be heard on the other side of the wall. Therefore, option (C) illustrates that sound waves can travel through two different types of media.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because talking to someone under the water in a pool is not a viable way to demonstrate that sound waves can travel through two different types of media. Option (B) is also incorrect because hearing a loud whisper from across the room does not demonstrate that sound waves can travel through two different types of media. Option (D) is incorrect because thunder is caused by sound waves traveling through the air, not through a liquid medium.",
  "arc_400": "The correct answer is (B) neutralize the solution with a base.\n\nWhen disposing of an acid solution after an experiment, it is important to neutralize the solution to prevent it from causing harm to the environment or people. Neutralizing the solution with a base, such as baking soda or sodium hydroxide, can help to neutralize the acidic properties of the solution and make it safe for disposal. Pouring the solution down the sink or diluting it with more acid can be harmful to the environment and should be avoided. Absorbing the liquid with paper towels is not a recommended method of disposal for acid solutions."
