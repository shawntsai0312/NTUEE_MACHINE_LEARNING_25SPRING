  "arc_71": "Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. The force that counteracts gravity to keep a satellite in orbit is the centripetal force, which is the force that keeps the satellite moving in a circular path around the Earth. The centripetal force is equal in magnitude to the centrifugal force, which is the force that would cause the satellite to fly off in a straight line. Since the centripetal force is equal in magnitude to the centrifugal force, the net force on the satellite is zero, and it will continue to move in a circular path around the Earth. Therefore, the answer is (A) inertia. The answer is (A) inertia.",

The stratosphere contains a high concentration of water vapor, which is responsible for the increase in temperature with altitude. This is because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, meaning that it traps heat from the sun and prevents it from being lost to space. As a result, the stratosphere retains more heat than the lower atmosphere, causing the temperature to increase with altitude. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. The answer is (B) water vapor.",

The circulatory system works with the respiratory system by transporting oxygen from the lungs to the organs of the body, such as the brain, liver, and kidneys, where it is used for metabolic processes. The respiratory system takes in oxygen and releases carbon dioxide through the process of respiration. Without the circulatory system, the oxygen would not be able to reach the organs of the body, and the body's metabolic processes would not be able to occur. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) transporting oxygen to organs.",

The Sun's energy heats the water in the oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing the water to evaporate and rise into the atmosphere as water vapor. As the water vapor rises, it cools and condenses into water droplets, forming clouds. These water droplets can then condense and form precipitation, such as rain or snow, depending on the temperature and humidity of the air. Therefore, the Sun is the primary source of energy that drives the water cycle by creating water droplets in the clouds. The answer is (B).",

This can lead to an increase in biodiversity and ecosystem productivity. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. The answer is (B) more fertile soils.",
  "arc_394": "The answer is (B) euglena. Euglena is a single-celled organism that has both plant-like and animal-like characteristics. It has chloroplasts, which are organelles that contain chlorophyll and are responsible for photosynthesis, and it also has a flagellum, which is a whip-like structure used for movement. Therefore, euglena must get nutrients from a transport system in order to survive. The other options, amoeba, skin cell, and bacterial cell, do not have the necessary organelles to obtain nutrients from a transport system. Therefore, they do not need to get nutrients from a transport system. The answer is (B) euglena.",
  "arc_397": "The correct answer is (A) increased use of fossil fuels. Wood-free paper is made from non-renewable resources such as cotton and rice waste, which require the use of fossil fuels to produce. Therefore, using wood-free paper increases the use of fossil fuels. The other options (B, C, and D) are not related to the use of wood-free paper. The answer is (A) increased use of fossil fuels.",
  "arc_399": "The correct answer is (C) hearing people talking on the other side of a wall. Sound waves can travel through two different types of media (solid and liquid) and can be heard on the other side of a wall. The other options do not illustrate that sound waves can travel through two different types of media: talking to someone under the water in a pool does not, hearing a loud whisper from across the room does not, and hearing thunder from a very distant storm does not. The answer is (C) hearing people talking on the other side of a wall.",
