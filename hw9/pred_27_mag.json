This increases the genetic diversity of the population, as the offspring are more likely to have a different combination of traits than either of their parents. In contrast, asexual reproduction only allows for the duplication of genetic material, resulting in offspring that are identical to their parent. This reduces the genetic diversity of the population, as the offspring are more likely to have the same traits as their parent. Therefore, sexual reproduction maintains genetic diversity, which is an advantage for the survival of a population. The answer is (B).",

However, the satellite is also moving at a constant velocity, which means that it has a certain amount of kinetic energy. This energy is what counteracts the force of gravity and keeps the satellite in orbit. Therefore, the answer is (A) inertia. The answer is (A) inertia.",
  "arc_73": "The correct answer is (A) decreases over a period of time and is lost. The ice cube melts because the energy of the particles decreases over time and is lost. The other options are incorrect.",

Friction is the force that opposes the motion of an object as it moves through a medium, such as air or water. As the rocket moves away from Earth, it must overcome the force of friction in order to continue its motion. Therefore, the force that the rocket must act against is the force of friction. The answer is (A) inertia. The statement \"the force that the rocket must act against as it moves away from Earth is the force of friction\" is correct. Therefore, the answer is (A) inertia.",
  "arc_94": "The correct answer is (B) water vapor. The stratosphere is a layer of the atmosphere that extends from about 12 to 40 kilometers (km) above the Earth's surface. The stratosphere contains a high concentration of water vapor, which is responsible for the increase in temperature with altitude. This is because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, meaning that it traps and retains heat from the sun, causing the temperature to rise. Therefore, the temperature of the stratosphere increases with altitude due to the presence of water vapor. Answer: (B)",

The circulatory system works with the respiratory system by transporting oxygen from the lungs to the organs of the body, such as the brain, liver, and kidneys. The respiratory system takes in oxygen and exhales carbon dioxide, while the circulatory system transports the oxygen to the organs. Without the circulatory system, the organs would not be able to receive the oxygen they need to function properly. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.",
  "arc_99": "The correct answer is (C) carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most significant contributor to the greenhouse effect due to its high concentration in the atmosphere and its ability to absorb and trap infrared radiation. Carbon dioxide is responsible for about 65% of the greenhouse effect, with the remaining contributions coming from other greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor. Therefore, the answer is (C) carbon dioxide. The answer is (C) carbon dioxide.",
  "arc_104": "The correct answer is (C) an increase in volcanic activity under the oceans. When volcanic activity increases, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also increases. As a result, the oceans become more acidic, which makes it difficult for oxygen-intolerant bacteria to survive. Therefore, the increase in volcanic activity led to the extinction of many oxygen-intolerant bacteria. The other options are not related to the extinction of oxygen-intolerant bacteria.",

Meiosis is the process by which a diploid organism produces haploid gametes (sperm or egg cells) that are capable of fusing to form a diploid zygote. This process is necessary for sexual reproduction, as it allows for the mixing of genetic material from two parents and the creation of genetically diverse offspring. Vegetative budding, on the other hand, is the process by which an organism produces a genetically identical copy of itself, without the involvement of meiosis. This process is not necessary for reproduction, as it does not involve the mixing of genetic material from two parents. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. The answer is (A) vegetative budding.",

The other options, a barometer, hygrometer, or weather vane, are not suitable for measuring wind speed before a storm.",
  "arc_121": "Answer: (B) The Sun creates water droplets in the clouds. The Sun's energy heats the water in the oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing the water to evaporate and rise into the atmosphere as water vapor. As the water vapor cools, it condenses into water droplets, forming clouds. The Sun's energy also causes the water droplets to condense and form precipitation, such as rain or snow. Therefore, the Sun most affects the water cycle by creating water droplets in the clouds. The answer is option (B). The answer is (B) The Sun creates water droplets in the clouds.",

Protons have a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu), and electrons have a mass of approximately 9.1 x 10^-31 amu. Therefore, if an atom lost a proton, it would lose approximately 1 amu of mass. This is the least amount of mass that an atom would lose. Similarly, if an atom lost an electron, it would lose approximately 9.1 x 10^-31 amu of mass. This is also the least amount of mass that an atom would lose. However, if an atom lost a neutron, it would lose approximately 10.172 GeV/c^2 of mass. This is much more than the mass loss of an electron or a proton. Therefore, an atom would lose the least amount of mass if it lost a proton.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) a proton.",
