  "arc_71": "Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. The force that counteracts gravity to keep a satellite in orbit is the centripetal force, which is the force that keeps the satellite moving in a circular path around the Earth. The centripetal force is equal in magnitude to the centrifugal force, which is the force that would cause the satellite to fly off in a straight line. Since the centripetal force is equal in magnitude to the centrifugal force, the net force on the satellite is zero, and it will continue to move in a circular path around the Earth. Therefore, the answer is (A) inertia. The answer is (A) inertia.",
  "arc_73": "The correct answer is (A) decreases over a period of time and is lost. The ice cube melts because the energy of the particles decreases over a period of time and is lost.

The answer is (C) microscope.",
  "arc_98": "The correct answer is (B) transporting oxygen to organs. The circulatory system works with the respiratory system by transporting oxygen from the lungs to the organs of the body, such as the brain, liver, and kidneys, where it is used for metabolic processes. The respiratory system takes in oxygen and releases carbon dioxide through the process of respiration. Without the circulatory system, the oxygen would not be able to reach the organs of the body, and the body's metabolic processes would not be able to occur. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) transporting oxygen to organs.",
  "arc_99": "The correct answer is (C) carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the substance that contributes most to the greenhouse effect due to its high concentration in the atmosphere and its ability to absorb infrared radiation. The greenhouse effect is the warming of the Earth's surface and atmosphere due to the trapping of infrared radiation by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas, accounting for about 65% of the total greenhouse effect. Wood smoke and nitrous oxides are also greenhouse gases, but they contribute less to the greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide. Nuclear radiation does not contribute to the greenhouse effect as it is not a greenhouse gas.",

These nutrients can cause an overgrowth of algae, leading to a lack of oxygen in the water, which can kill fish and other aquatic organisms.",
  "arc_120": "The student should use an anemometer to measure changes in wind speed several hours before a storm. An anemometer is a device that measures wind speed by measuring the force exerted by the wind on a stationary object, such as a propeller or a fan. It is the best tool for measuring wind speed because it measures the speed of the wind at a specific point in space, unlike a barometer, which measures atmospheric pressure, or a hygrometer, which measures the amount of moisture in the air. A weather vane measures the direction of the wind, but not its speed. Therefore, the student should use an anemometer to measure changes in wind speed several hours before a storm. The answer is (C).",
  "arc_121": "The Sun most affects the water cycle by creating water droplets in the clouds. The Sun's energy heats the water in the oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing the water to evaporate and rise into the atmosphere as water vapor. As the water vapor rises, it cools and condenses into water droplets, forming clouds. These water droplets can then condense and form precipitation, such as rain or snow, depending on the temperature and humidity of the air. Therefore, the Sun is the primary source of energy that drives the water cycle by creating water droplets in the clouds. The answer is (B).",
