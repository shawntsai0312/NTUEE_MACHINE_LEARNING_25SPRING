  "arc_61": "Answer: (B) maintains genetic diversity.\nExplanation: Sexual reproduction allows for the mixing of genetic material from two parents, resulting in offspring that inherit a unique combination of traits from each parent. This increases the genetic diversity of the population, as the offspring are more likely to have a different combination of traits than either of their parents. In contrast, asexual reproduction only allows for the duplication of genetic material, resulting in offspring that are identical to their parent. This reduces the genetic diversity of the population, as the offspring are more likely to have the same traits as their parent. Therefore, sexual reproduction maintains genetic diversity, which is an advantage for the survival of a population. The answer is (B).",
