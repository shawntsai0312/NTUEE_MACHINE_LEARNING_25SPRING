This EMF causes a current to flow through the lightbulb. Therefore, the device was created to generate an electric current. The answer is (A) to generate an electric current. The answer is (A) to generate an electric current.",
  "arc_386": "The man's mass is 60 kg and the boy's mass is 25 kg, so their combined mass is 60 + 25 = <<60+25=85>>85 kg.\nTheir combined momentum is 85 * 10 = <<85*10=850>>850 kg m/s.\nTheir combined velocity is 850/2 = <<850/2=425>>425 km/h.\nTheir combined distance traveled is 425 * 60 = <<425*60=25500>>25500 km.\nTheir combined time is 25500 / 425 = <<25500/425=60>>60 s.\nTheir combined acceleration is 25500 / 85 = <<25500/85=30>>30 m/s^2.\nTheir combined deceleration is 25500 / 85 = <<25500/85=30>>30 m/s^2.\nTheir combined distance traveled is 25500 km.\nTheir combined time is 60 s.\nTheir combined acceleration is 30 m/s^2.\nTheir combined deceleration is 30 m/s^2.\nTherefore, the motion of the two people can be described as follows:\nThe man moves farther and faster than the boy.\nThe boy moves farther and faster than the man.\nThe man moves farther but the same speed as the boy.\nThe boy moves faster but the same distance as the man. The answer is (D). The answer is (",
  "arc_387": "The correct answer is (B) sweating from the skin to lower inner heat levels. When Sean felt the room become cooler, his body adjusted to enable him to survive by sweating from the skin to lower inner heat levels. This enabled his body to continue to function correctly. The answer is (B) sweating from the skin to lower inner heat levels.",
  "arc_389": "The statement that was changed because new information became available is (B) Plants make their own food.",
  "arc_392": "The answer is (B) more fertile soils. A flood can increase the amount of nutrients in the water, making it more fertile. This can lead to an increase in plant growth along the riverbanks, providing more habitat for aquatic animals. The answer is (B) more fertile soils.",
  "arc_394": "The answer is (B) euglena. Euglena is a single-celled organism that has both plant-like and animal-like characteristics. It has chlorophyll, so it can make its own food through photosynthesis, and it also has flagella, so it can move independently. Therefore, euglena must get nutrients from a transport system. The other options do not have both plant-like and animal-like characteristics, so they do not need to get nutrients from a transport system. The answer is (B) euglena.",
  "arc_397": "The correct answer is (A) increased use of fossil fuels. Using wood-free paper requires the use of fossil fuels to power the machines that make the paper. Therefore, the use of wood-free paper increases the use of fossil fuels. The answer is (A) increased use of fossil fuels. The answer is (A) increased use of fossil fuels.",
  "arc_399": "The correct answer is (C) hearing people talking on the other side of a wall. Sound waves can travel through two different types of media (air and the wall) and can be heard on the other side of the wall. The other options do not illustrate that sound waves can travel through two different types of media. The answer is (C) hearing people talking on the other side of a wall.",
  "arc_400": "The proper procedure for safely disposing of an acid solution after finishing an experiment is to neutralize the solution with a base. This will neutralize the acid and make the solution safe for disposal."
