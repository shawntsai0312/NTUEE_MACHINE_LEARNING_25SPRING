Conversely, those who accumulate too many negative points could be restricted in their movements or subjected to increased supervision. \nA third solution could be to implement a community service program, where inmates are required to perform a certain number of hours of community service each week.

Integrating these sources into everyday households and businesses can be achieved through incentive programs, such as tax credits and rebates, and by encouraging people to switch to renewable energy sources. Examples of how this can be achieved include offering discounts on solar panels and other renewable energy technologies, promoting energy-efficient appliances and lighting, and encouraging people to switch to electric transportation."
