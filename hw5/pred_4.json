Inmates who accumulate a certain number of points could be granted additional privileges, such as access to educational programs or increased time in the common area. Conversely, those who accumulate too many negative points could be restricted in their movements or subjected to increased supervision. \nA third solution could be to implement a community service program, where inmates are required to perform a certain number of hours of community service each week.

Over time, improvements were made to the can opener, including the addition of a cutting wheel and the use of more powerful mechanisms such as electric motors. Today, there are several types of can openers available, ranging from manual to electric and even automatic models. The most common designs include traditional handheld models, standalone machines, and built-in features on kitchen appliances such as food processors and blenders. Some of the most influential figures in the development of the can opener include Lyman, French inventor Louis Sauret, and German engineer Eugen von Kssmal."
